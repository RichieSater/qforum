I notice at the bottom of your IDE there are buttons to run and step through the program, with values displayed in the memory registers !   Cool !

<p>Only, when I access my account online, those buttons aren&#39;t there.   Can you turn them on ?  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>Hey Josh/Seong,</p>

<p>Thanks for putting together the comprehensive tutorials and software. I&#39;m new to Quantopian, but have been super impressed with what you guys have here.</p>

<p>A couple questions around this Piotroski algorithm:</p>

<ol>
<li>As other have mentioned, any update on when historicals can be queried without first tracking data for a year?<br></li>
<li>To hack above if this feature isn&#39;t working yet (thinking out loud here), is a reasonable approach to run the algo in the backtester, grab the last year&#39;s worth of data in the data panel, then append that to the algo before turning it live? This way the algo would have seed data to start making comparisons from day 1? Is there a way to easily export a data panel from the IDE?<br></li>
<li>I&#39;m curious why you chose 25 trading days to approximate rebalancing every month. Wouldn&#39;t it be easier to just use schedule function and do month start with an optional offset?<br></li>
<li>Any updates on the errors that others were seeing with the shorts?</li>
</ol>

<p>Thanks. Very much appreciated.  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>Great questions.</p>

<p>We&#39;re still working on getting historical data queried without first tracking data for a year - once that&#39;s solved you won&#39;t have to worry about your  second question. As for an immediate solution, the easiest solution is simply accumulate a data panel day-over-day until it has enough data for you to do your calculations on. </p>

<p>The algorithm was created before schedule_function was released but you could just as easily replace it with schedule_function with an optional offset.</p>

<p>As for the shorts, it wasn&#39;t an error as much as that there were A LOT of stocks with scores less than 2. Go figure. The best way to offset this is simply limit the number of shorts that you find, like I do in this code:</p>

<pre><code>
def rebalance(context, data, scores):  
    &quot;&quot;&quot;  
        This method takes in the scores found by get_piotroski_scores and orders our portfolio accordingly  
    &quot;&quot;&quot;  
    #: Find which stocks we need to long and which ones we need to short  
    num_long = [stock for stock in scores if scores[stock] &gt;= 7]  
    num_short = [stock for stock in scores if scores[stock] &lt;= 2][:len(num_long)]  
    #: Stocks to long  
    for stock in num_long:  
        if stock in data:  
            log.info(&quot;Going long on stock %s with score %s&quot; % (stock.symbol, scores[stock]))  
            order_target_percent(stock, 1.0/len(num_long))  
    #: Stocks to short  
    for stock in num_short:  
        if stock in data:  
            log.info(&quot;Going short on stock %s with score %s&quot; % (stock.symbol, scores[stock]))  
            order_target_percent(stock, -1.0/len(num_short))  
    #: Exit any positions we might have  
    for stock in context.portfolio.positions:  
        if stock in data and stock not in num_long and stock not in num_short:  
            log.info(&quot;Exiting our positions on %s&quot; % (stock.symbol))  
            order_target_percent(stock, 0)  
    record(number_long=len(num_long))  
    record(number_short=len(num_short))

Are you referring &quot;historical fundamentals data&quot; to mean daily fundamental going back any days back?  Or can we now specify which date in the past?  I remember having some performance issue pulling 250 some lines of fundamental data in order to look back some financial data a year ago.  Never the less I had to pull daily going back some 252 days causing clock out (performance issues).  I know another staff from Quantopian mentioned that they were working on it.<br>

<p>I completely understand your frustration. We are actively working on speeding up fundamentals and exposing TTM versions of each field. It&#39;s a major project, and his been underway for a few months already. The first milestone we are aiming for is to speed up fundamental data retrieval in pipeline. After that, we will be looking at the TTM fields. Again, the project is actively underway, but it involves a complete re-write of how we load and store the fundamental data, so it has taken some time.  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>Hi Jamie,</p>

<p>well, this is a very good news! Would it be also possible to get the last n-years for example of Total Revenues or similar?<br>
Is the new timeframe feature  going to only meet the Pipeline API or also get_fundamentals()?<br>
I know that get_fundamentals() is quite neglected but I hope it will not be leaved out: simple and fast as it is, has also many advantages!</p>

<p>I don&#39;t ask you for a timeline, just keep us informed about the developments and keep up the good work!  </p>

I cloned the Piotroski score pipeline example you posted to the forum thread below. I ran the backtest and got MemoryError Constantino mentioned.<br>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>Hi Henry,</p>

<p>Thanks for pointing that out. I think this may be different from what Costantino was referring to. In the example I posted in that other thread, the pipeline was making 100-day history requests every day, whereas the version using get_fundamentals was only getting values for a single day (yesterday), and building up a structure containing a longer history. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I understand that the memory issue is a limitation - we&#39;ll look into a solution to this problem. However, I don&#39;t think this is a drawback of the Pipeline API, it&#39;s a result of a bigger request being made (get_fundamentals could only query fundamental data from the previous day.  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>Hi Jamie,<br>
Sorry to revisit this. But I keep running into memory issues with the pipeline. So, I was thinking. And this might be naive because I am still getting used to pipeline api and to be honest am new to python. But it might help if there were some way to filter factor input. For example in case of Piotroski score you just compare the last value to first in the specified window. All other historical data in between are ignored. So, is there any way to filter what data are loaded in the factor?</p>

<p>BTW Thank you for supporting the community and for all your feedback.  </p>
