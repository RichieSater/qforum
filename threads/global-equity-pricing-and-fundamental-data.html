<p>Pricing and fundamentals data for each of these countries is available as far back as 2004. The pricing data is daily, including OHLCV bars. Global fundamentals are sourced from the recently announced <a href="https://www.quantopian.com/posts/new-dataset-factset-fundamentals">FactSet Fundamentals</a> data integration. All global equity data is accessed using a new Pipeline feature, <strong>domains</strong>, described below and in the attached notebook.</p>

<hr>
<h2 id='stronginternational-pipelines-amp-domainsstrong'><a class='clickable-header-link' href='#stronginternational-pipelines-amp-domainsstrong'><strong>International Pipelines &amp; Domains</strong></a></h2>

<p>Pipeline is a tool that allows you to define computations over a universe of assets and a period of time. In the past, you could only run pipelines on the US equity market. As of today, you can now specify a <code>domain</code> over which a pipeline should be computed. The name &quot;domain&quot; refers to the mathematical concept of the &quot;domain of a function&quot;, which is the set of potential inputs to a function. In the context of Pipeline, the domain specifies the set of assets and a corresponding trading calendar over which the expressions of a pipeline should be computed.</p>

<p>Currently, there are 26 domains available in the Pipeline API corresponding to the countries in the table above. The attached notebook explains pipeline domains in more detail.</p>

<p><strong>Example Usage</strong></p>

<p>The following pipeline returns the latest close price, volume, and market cap for all Canadian equities, every day. Make sure to run it in <strong>Research</strong>.</p>

<pre><code>from quantopian.pipeline import Pipeline  
from quantopian.pipeline.data import EquityPricing, factset  
from quantopian.pipeline.domain import CA_EQUITIES  
from quantopian.research import run_pipeline

pipe = Pipeline(  
    columns={  
        &#39;price&#39;: EquityPricing.close.latest,  
        &#39;volume&#39;: EquityPricing.volume.latest,  
        &#39;mcap&#39;: factset.Fundamentals.mkt_val.latest,  
    },  
    domain=CA_EQUITIES,  
)

result = run_pipeline(pipe, &#39;2015-01-15&#39;, &#39;2016-01-15&#39;)  
result.head()  
</code></pre>

<p>To learn more about domains, see the attached notebook. If you&#39;re curious, you can read more about the design behind domains in this <a href="https://github.com/quantopian/zipline/issues/2265">Zipline issue</a>.</p>

<hr>
<h2 id='strongcurrency-conversionsstrong'><a class='clickable-header-link' href='#strongcurrency-conversionsstrong'><strong>Currency Conversions</strong></a></h2>

<p>One of the challenges in working with international financial data is the fact that prices and price based fields can be denominated in different currencies. Even if you only want to research stocks listed on a single exchange, currencies can present a challenge. For example, a company that is based in the US (like Apple), reports their financials in USD, but lists shares on exchanges around the world. These listings are often denominated in the local currency of the exchange. Having pricing and fundamentals data denominated in different currencies makes it hard to make comparisons between the two datasets. </p>

<p>To solve this problem, FactSet Fundamentals data is denominated in the listing currency of each asset. For example, if you query sales data for the US listing of Apple, you will get data denominated in USD. If you look up fundamentals for the Japanese listing of Apple (listed in Japanese Yen), you will get data from the same US report, but it will be converted to Japanese Yen. The specific conversion techniques are as follows:</p>

<p><strong>Income Statement and Cash Flow Statement</strong></p>

<p>Data from the income statement and cash flow statement of a fundamentals report is converted using the average exchange rate over the fiscal period in question.</p>

<p><strong>Balance Sheet</strong></p>

<p>Data from the balance sheet of a report is converted using the exchange rate from the end of the fiscal period of the report (i.e. the end of Q1 for a Q1 quarterly report).</p>

<hr>
<h2 id='strongother-notesstrong'><a class='clickable-header-link' href='#strongother-notesstrong'><strong>Other Notes</strong></a></h2>

<p><strong>Contest Eligibility</strong></p>

<p>Unfortunately, international markets are not yet supported in the backtester, and by extension, they are not yet supported in the contest. We don’t currently have a timeline for a contest that supports international markets. We will provide an update to the community when we have more information to share.</p>

<p><strong>Alphalens</strong></p>

<p>Alphalens is currently the best tool for analyzing a factor on an international market. To date, we have suggested that you use <code>get_pricing</code> to get daily pricing data and supply it to Alphalens. International pricing data isn&#39;t yet available in <code>get_pricing</code>, which motivated us to revisit this suggestion. After poking around a bit, we put together a wrapper function that makes it easy to write a pipeline factor and run it through alphalens without having to write all of the get_pricing boilerplate code. The notebook attached in the comment below includes the wrapper function <code>evaluate_factor</code>. You can use <code>evaluate_factor</code> to evaluate a factor on any domain.</p>

<p><strong>Holdouts</strong></p>

<p>As described in <a href="https://www.quantopian.com/posts/new-dataset-factset-fundamentals">this post</a>, the most recent year of FactSet Fundamentals data is held out from the community platform, which applies to both US and international data. The same holdout applies to the daily OHLCV data for non-US markets. This means that all research on international factors will need to be conducted on data that is more than a year old. We are hopeful that the holdout will actually help to reduce the risk of overfitting. </p>

<p><strong>Documentation</strong></p>

<p>The notebook in this post is the best reference material on domains at this time. We plan to add documentation and other learning material around domains in the near term.</p>

<p><strong>Multi-Currency Markets</strong></p>

<p>Another challenge related to currencies is the fact that some exchanges don&#39;t require stocks to be listed in local currency. For example, the London Stock Exchange only has about 75% of its listings denominated in GBP*. The other 25% are primarily listed in EUR or USD. This can make it hard to make cross sectional comparisons. </p>

<p>To solve this problem, most people rely on currency conversions to bring price-based fields into the same currency. Currently, there&#39;s no way to convert pricing and fundamentals data, so everything is denominated in the listing currency (the default). In addition, the listing currency information isn&#39;t yet accessible, so you don&#39;t have an easy way to determine the currency of a particular data point. Our long-term plan is to solve this problem and make it easy to conduct analyses across assets listed in different currencies. </p>

<p>In the meantime, currency-dependent fundamentals fields are not yet available for assets that are listed in a non-primary currency of their exchange. Pricing data for non-primary currency assets <em>is</em> available, but you should use returns instead of raw prices to build a factor on a non-US domain (probably a good idea anyway!). Working in returns space instead of pricing makes it reasonable to make comparisons across assets listed in different currencies.</p>

<p>*Great Britain, Switzerland, and Ireland all have a significant number of assets listed in non-local currency. Other markets have the vast majority, if not all of their listings in local currency.</p>

<p><strong>Combining Domains</strong></p>

<p>Pipelines can now be defined with new domains, but the idea of &#39;combining&#39; domains is not yet supported. When working with international equity data, it is a common use case to develop a factor at a regional level (for example, Europe) instead of a country level. We plan to support multi-country domains, but don&#39;t yet have a timeline on the delivery of this feature.</p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>@Adhish: NSE and BSE data is included. The original post on this thread lists the supported exchanges for each market. Regarding FnO data, is that short for &#39;Futures &amp; Options&#39;? If so, the answer is no. We currently support equity pricing and fundamentals data.</p>

<p>@Pieter-Jan: Right now, there isn&#39;t an easy way to combine domains/countries. If you want, you can merge the output of pipeline results from different countries, but it will take some manual effort. If you want to merge the outputs, remember that all price-based data is denominated in local currency, so you should try to move any price-based factors to returns space before combining them.  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>@Boris: We plan to add support for global equity trading in the backtester, but we don&#39;t have a timeline as to when it will be available.</p>

<p>@Apoorv: Thanks for pointing out the typo. I just edited the post to correct it.</p>

<p>@Ma: Yes, prices are adjusted for splits and dividends just like our US data. They will be adjusted point-in-time in Pipeline. There&#39;s an explanation <a href="https://www.quantopian.com/quantopian2/adjustments">here</a> that you might find helpful. Regarding fundamentals data, FactSet provides a report date for most records. When a record has a report date, it is surfaced the following day in Pipeline. In cases where we don&#39;t get a report date, the report is artificially delayed based on the reporting criteria of the country in which it trades. For instance, in the US, quarterly reports can be filed up to 45 days after the end of the fiscal period to which the report corresponds. Annual reports can be published up to 60 calendar days after the fiscal year end. FactSet fundamental data in Pipeline is lagged accordingly when the report date is not available.</p>

<p>Does this help?</p>

<p>As described in this post, the most recent year of FactSet Fundamentals data is held out from the community platform, which applies to both US and international data. The same holdout applies to the daily OHLCV data for non-US markets. This means that all research on international factors will need to be conducted on data that is more than a year old.

<p>I&#39;m looking through how evaluate_factor is built, and according to my tests of the Returns function, if we want to use forward returns when evaluate a factor, we should backshift returns series by X+1, rather than by X (where X is the return window), is that correct?  Or is there something I&#39;m not seeing yet?</p>

<p>I’m puzzled by the dataset behavior in the attached notebook. I noticed that when analyzing my alpha factor on international data, performance would be dominated by the size factor. Upon digging deeper, I found that longing all stocks in a market, applying less strict volume filters, gives exaggerated returns. This effect is at its extreme with no volume filter, as can be seen in the attached notebook. </p>

<p>Any ideas what might be causing this behavior and how to avoid it? </p>

<p>Sorry for the late reply, I have been away.  It is a bit difficult to describe this in a post but I will try... I also suppose that it also depends on trading assumptions.</p>

<p>I used a single US stock as an example.  The gist of it is that in the resultant Returns from the Pipeline, the return value for June 6th is actually the return from June 2nd (close price) to June 5th (close price) - June 3 and 4 is a weekend, and June 5 is a Monday.</p>

<p>When I do research, usually I denote returns as 
<code>
close_price_today/close_price_yesterday  
</code></p>

<p>Similarly, 1-day forward returns would be <code>
close_price_tomorrow/close_price_today  
</code></p>

<p>If I wanted simple return, I would need to backshift the Returns by 1, so that the June 6th return is actually marked as June 5th (according to the conventions I use above).</p>

<p>If I wanted forward return, I would need to backshift the Returns by 2 (or X+1, where X is the return window and X=1).  The forward return for June 2nd would be the close_price_June_5th / close_price_June_2nd</p>

<p>And usually when we evaluate the power of a factor we want to use forward returns.  If we don&#39;t, there is a bit of lookahead bias there.  That is why I think when passing in the data to the alphalens tearsheet, the returns should be backshifted by X+1, rather than X - unless alphalens does some shifting that I don&#39;t know about?  </p>

<p>This is very important from a macro perspective. Take the USA as an example, nothing in the set 2004-2018 looks anything like the stagflation of the 1970s, nor is there anything to compare with the rampant inflation of the 1980s. There is no way to predict when these phases of the economic cycle will return, so it is good to have algos prepared to weather the storm (think Ray Dalio&#39;s &quot;All Weather&quot; portfolio) by showing back-tested resiliency through such environments.  </p>

<p>I narrowed the issue down a bit. Returns seem to be overstated only for foreign data. Below is another notebook with only minimal changes compared to your example notebook, so you can better follow it. It shows that longing all stocks of the Canadian market gives a Sharpe of 18. Clearly something must be wrong. Using the same code, returns for the US market seem normal.  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>There are several good questions on this thread. Sorry for the delay in responding! I&#39;ll respond to each of the questions in separate threads:</p>

<p>@Jan: Thanks for sharing that notebook. I took a look, and I believe you&#39;re seeing the crazy (too good to be true) looking returns because of the tradable universe selected in your example. Remember that alphalens only compares factor values to forward looking price movement. There&#39;s no transaction costs, slippage, etc. Because of this, it&#39;s <em>extremely</em> important to choose a tradable universe that contains liquid stocks. If you look into some of the lower volume stocks in Canada, you can see that there are several days with 0 volume where there are big price movements. This suggests that if you were to actually try buying the stock, you&#39;d face very high transaction costs. You might not even be able to open a short position when the volume is that low. I&#39;ve attached a notebook that displays the volume of a penny stock in Canada as well as the result of the size factor with a fairly simple volume filter.</p>

<p>I poked around some of the lower volume US equities, and even the &#39;illiquid&#39; stocks have more volume than the least liquid equities in Canada. My guess is that you&#39;re not seeing this pattern in the US because we don&#39;t support US equities trading on over-the-counter (OTC) exchanges. These would likely get filtered out in most tradable universe filters like the <a href="https://www.quantopian.com/help#quantopian_pipeline_filters_QTradableStocksUS">QTradableStocksUS</a> anyway.</p>

<p>Let me know if this helps.</p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>@MJ: Thanks for clarifying your question. I think I understand what you&#39;re asking now. You&#39;re right that the output format of the Pipeline API is displayed in such a way that the 2-day return in the row with index date June 6th is computed using the close price from June 5th (Monday) and June 2nd (Friday). That said, this is the convention for <em>all</em> factors in Pipeline, not just returns. This convention comes from the fact that a pipeline is expected to be run in the morning, prior to market open. The date you see in the output represents when the pipeline would have been run. I understand the argument that you&#39;re making: you expect a different format, so in order to get forward looking returns <strong>and</strong> get the date format to match your expectation, you&#39;d need to shift the results by X+1. However, I think both solutions are reasonable, each with a different set of assumptions going into them. Regardless of the choice, the result isn&#39;t a perfect simulation. The return is capturing the price movement from one market close to the next. In the &#39;shift by X&#39; approach,  the analysis assumes that you hold each position starting on the trading day prior to the factor being computed, through to the close price at the end of the current day. The &#39;shift everything X+1&#39; uses the close price at the end of the day of the factor to the end of the following day (also not perfect). In reality, a portfolio would have to open a position in each stock some time during market hours in reaction to the factor value changing. </p>

<p>Remember, Alphalens is a factor analysis tool. It skips some of the detail like intraday order filling, transaction costs, etc. that are normally handled by the backtester so some approximations need to be made (this is true of any simulation, really). If you think it is a better assumption to shift by X+1, then you should do it! I think the solution depends a bit on how/when your orders to be placed and filled.  </p>

<p><strong>Does the (one year) holdout period apply only to FactSet fundamental data or does it also apply to prices of international stocks?</strong><br>
The one year holdout also applies to pricing data. From the original post: &quot;The same holdout applies to the daily OHLCV data for non-US markets.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Can I use AlphaLens with a fundamental factor end_date one year ago and (forward) returns up to 12 months (deep into the holdout period)?</strong><br>
Unfortunately, you cannot. This would require accessing pricing data from within the period of held-out data. That said, the holdout period is a trailing window, so you will be able to test over more and more data as time goes on.  </p>

<p>Thanks for your reply. I was baffled by the returns since I thought I was just longing all stocks. Thinking about it again, I realized that this is not the case. Since I aggregate the stocks into a portfolio by an arithmetic mean daily. I run an implicit mean-reversion strategy on an extremely illiquid universe, which of course overstates returns.  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>@Will: Sorry for the delayed response. Currently self-serve data only supports the upload of data mapped to US equities. We will likely build global support for custom data uploads in the future, but there&#39;s no timetable on when it will be done. Sorry for the inconvenience.</p>

<p>@ChorHuat: Yes, we do have long-term plans to add the rest of the &#39;emerging&#39; markets in the <a href="https://www.msci.com/acwi">MSCI ACWI Index</a>. However, I don&#39;t have a timeline on when that will happen yet. We will post on this thread when that work gets picked up. You can also track the list of supported markets and exchanges in the <a href="https://www.quantopian.com/docs/data-reference/overview">Data Reference</a>.</p>

<p>@Pedro: The holdout is expected. In the original post, they are described under the <strong>Holdouts</strong> section:</p>

<p>&quot;As described in <a href="https://www.quantopian.com/posts/new-dataset-factset-fundamentals">this post</a>, the most recent year of FactSet Fundamentals data is held out from the community platform, which applies to both US and international data. The same holdout applies to the daily OHLCV data for non-US markets. This means that all research on international factors will need to be conducted on data that is more than a year old. We are hopeful that the holdout will actually help to reduce the risk of overfitting.&quot;</p>

<p>We do not currently have plans to lift these holdouts. However, we do have long-term plans to extend our fund to include international data at some point. When that happens, it will likely include a contest in which global strategies can be run with up-to-date data. I don&#39;t have any more info to offer on this topic at this time because these plans are still quite distant, but my guess is it will be a similar experience to how FactSet data like <a href="https://www.quantopian.com/docs/data-reference/estimates_consensus">Consensus Estimates</a> can be used in the contest today.</p>

<p>@Krzysztof: This is similar to the question about Malaysian equities. We have long-term plans to add the rest of the &#39;emerging&#39; markets in the <a href="https://www.msci.com/acwi">MSCI ACWI Index</a> which includes Poland.</p>
