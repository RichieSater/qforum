<div class='body-text-container post-body'><p>Have been lurking for a while and was thinking about backtesting in general.</p>

<p>As I understand it, Quantopian does backtesting against actual historical data.  But for many trading strategies that could be quite misleading.  Think about the space of all trading strategies for regular stocks (no options or futures etc).  The trading strategies that are going to backtest well are the ones that pick the winners from the past.  As other&#39;s have noted in the community, if a trading strategy simply bought apple it would backtest extremely well.  For this simple example the bias is easy to spot, but for complex trading strats there could be hidden bias of this type.  The problem is that those trading strats might completely fail on future data if they can&#39;t pick the new winners.</p>

<p>I am wondering if it is possible to eliminate this bias by backtesting in a different manner.  What if you used the historical data to build a statistical model of the market or part of it.  Such a model could include the risk free rate, historic volatilities, and correlations between stocks, etc.  You could then run a monte Carlo simulation where you backtest against multiple, statistically generated historical data.  You could use this to develop statistics about how the strategy works in a broader sense.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think this back testing approach would work well for all trading strategies.  I can can also imagine that this is equivalent to forward testing against statistically generated future data.  So this might not be that useful after all.  But <em>somehow</em> there has to be a way to backtest is a manner that eliminates these sources of problems.  Thoughts?  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>@Brian, this is one of my favorite topics in backtesting. One of the things I like best about your idea is the underlying perspective on backtesting. In the industry, I always hear &quot;I&#39;ve never seen a backtest I didn&#39;t like&quot;. There&#39;s an inherent danger of overfitting when you rely on historical backtests. I still see historical backtests as immensely useful - especially as a thorough and functional test of your algorithm. If you run 10 years of data through an algorithm, it is very likely you will discover edge cases for your code. Historical tests are also great for evaluating algorithms in extreme circumstances, like October of 2008. </p>

<p>But, as much as I see value in historical backtesting, I agree it isn&#39;t a sure way to predict performance, nor is it a complete exploration of an algorithm&#39;s behavior. Statistically simulated data is another popular approach. What I&#39;ve heard about is more like scenario analysis, where you see how your algorithm behaves under (usually distressful) situations. This is similar to historical backtesting through periods like the summer of 2007 and October of 2008, but you can specify the type of disaster you want your algo to endure -- perhaps a sudden change in correlations, or a broad market correction. Mixing this with your idea, you could run a chunk of data that approximates the statistical behavior of a real historical period, and then suddenly switch to a new regime.</p>

<h1>Zipline can do this!</h1>

<p>Practically speaking, Zipline datasources are implemented as generators (Zipline will be OSS in time for PyData). A trivial example is a sawtooth datasource that @Thomas wrote for our parameter optimization development. The only requirement is to yield dictionaries with the right properties (datetime, open, high, low, close, price, volume) and at the right frequency (daily or minute-ly). We designed Zipline with the expectation that new datasources would emerge once we started shipping the software, and specifically of synthetic sources like the one you propose.</p>

<p>Maybe there is a collaboration for us in creating this statistical source?  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>@John this is great news that you have thought about these things already, even in the design of Zipline.  That is fantastic.  There are two related issues then:</p>

<ol>
<li>Creating a statistical source to use in the backtesting.<br></li>
<li>Running a backtest with that source repeatedly to generate statistics.</li>
</ol>

<p>Do you envision that Quantopian itself would design the statistical sources, or do you think that you would allow users to do that (or possibly both)?  And would you consider allowing multiple backtest runs that are aggregated statistically?  I could imagine that if Q were to design really good stat sources, it could be a huge competitive advantage and drive people to your site.  I could also imagine that it would be nice to allow advanced users to tweak them. </p>

<p>One question: is your current backtesting against individual trades/orders (at possible irregular times) or batched to 1 minute intervals?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think it would be too difficult to create some basic statistical sources...  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>@Brian, thanks for the reply and the questions, you&#39;ve made me think quite a lot! </p>

<p>I think we would want to provide statistical sources to be competitive, but ultimately I think people will want to provide their own too. I would want the quantopian stat sources to be part of the opensource zipline project. Like the slippage models, the sources are an area that would benefit from broad adoption and scrutiny. </p>

<p>We recently added configurable <a href="https://www.quantopian.com/help#ide-slippage">slippage and commission models</a>, and one of the very first requests was for users to be able to supply their own implementation. I expect that will be a trend - people want all the key components to be pluggable. </p>

<p>For sources, I think something like this would be nice:</p>

<pre><code>@data_source  
def my_data_source(universe):  
   # universe is the current universe of securities  
   # ... create trade events ...  
   for event in trade_events:  
       yield event

def initialize(context):  
    set_source(my_data_source)

<p>We would absolutely allow for multiple concurrent backtests. As you can imagine, we do that a lot now, it is just done for several users, whereas you would want to trigger multiple concurrent backtests as a single user. <a href="http://blog.quantopian.com/parameter-optimization/">It reminds me of the parameter optimization work Thomas is doing</a>.</p>

<p>We use minute bars and daily bars, rather than individual trades. However, there isn&#39;t anything in the zipline structure that would prevent you from simulating tick level data, or even quote data. Events have types, so you can distinguish between trades and quotes, or news sentiment, etc. In many ways, statistically generating higher frequency data is the biggest payoff - the simulation time would be as good as possible since no data IO is needed.</p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>Yes, this issue is definitely related to parameter optimization.  If you are optimizing only against historical data, you are optimizing for the past = overfitting.  Being able to optimize against statistical data sources would hopefully soften that.</p>

<p>I think the simplest type of statistical source would be to use the historical data for a set of SIDs to calculate the statistical properties required to do a correlated log-normal simulation.  Don&#39;t know anything about how to simulate trading volumes though.  Anyone know anything about that?  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>This is a fascinating thread.</p>

<p>@Brian: I agree that overfitting is a huge problem (although the walk-forward optimization helps with that somewhat). But in general, I think backtesting on historical data is but one way to increase your confidence in a trading strategy. Testing on simulated sources is another good way (if it is close enough to reality). One could e.g. imagine a whole battery of different market types (bear, bull etc) that an algorithm is tested on to see where room for improvement is likely to be. There seems to be a good amount of literature on how to simulate stock prices (like the lognormal model you mentioned, see <a href="http://www.actuarialseminars.com/Misc/Lognormal.pdf">here</a> for a good introduction). The <a href="http://www.ms.unimelb.edu.au/publications/RampertshammerStefan.pdf">Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process</a> also seems relevant, especially in the context of pair trading.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know about simulating trading volumes. But couldn&#39;t one exploit the <a href="https://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=4491336">relationship between price and volume</a>? In essence, if one has a good price model and a good handle on how this correlates with volume, one should be able to generate associated volume information.</p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>@fawce – perhaps one way for the system itself to ‘dampen’ the effects of over-fitting would for it to automatically hold-out, say, the last 6 months of tick-data from that which is available to users as they build/optimize their strategies.  When the user is ready to ‘commit’ their final strategy, not only is the strategy run (and results reported) against the historic-data set of their selection (as they are currently in the system), but it’s also run separately against the out-of-sample data that has been held back.  Results could be reported separately for this.  Just a thought…<br>

<p>@Tim - Yes, we see the need to provide a clean in-sample/out-of-sample split on the historical trade data. Our current thought is that we should guide, but not force, users to take advantage of this split. On some level, an individual quantopian just has to be disciplined about not overfitting, but right now we don&#39;t provide any conveniences to define the split, honor it in development time, and give you a heads up when you are using the out of sample.  </p>
