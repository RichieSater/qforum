<div class='body-text-container post-body'><p>Most financial analysts will agree that managers often have an informational advantage. This advantage can lead to a number of decisions like when an executive decides to dump company shares prior to a poor company update or when a company announces a buyback to boost share prices after a bad quarter. In fact, the latter seems to be a common occurrence.</p>

<p>Shahram Amini and Vijay Singal from Virginia Tech propose that managers use their information edge to time corporate actions close to quarterly announcements in order to maximize shareholder value. Their whitepaper, <a href="http://quantpedia.com/Screener/Details/271">&quot;Are Earnings Predictable?&quot;</a>, examines the effects of share buybacks and issues surrounding an earnings announcement. The study documents consistent positive abnormal returns for earnings announcements following buyback announcements with similarly negative abnormal returns for share issues regardless of the earnings themselves. This is quite surprising because it indicates that &quot;that the market adjustment to corporate actions is incomplete, and can result in predictability of earnings announcements.&quot;</p>

<p>Our friends at <a href="http://quantpedia.com/">Quantpedia</a> provide a <a href="http://quantpedia.com/Screener/Details/271">possible explanation for the market&#39;s reaction</a>:           </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The academic paper states that it is generally accepted that managers<br>
have more information about the firm than investors. Given this<br>
information asymmetry, managers can make informed decisions about<br>
corporate actions such as equity offerings or repurchases. The<br>
announcement of stock repurchase or secondary equity offering is<br>
voluntary and can be easily moved by a few weeks or months. Therefore<br>
the timing of SEO or repurchase announcement before earnings<br>
announcement could be perceived as important information about future<br>
performance of stock during earnings announcement period.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In order to validate the authors&#39; research, my notebook (<a href="https://www.quantopian.com/clone_notebook?id=578926cd20d04eb0d0000bb4">view the notebook to see a walkthrough of the whitepaper</a>) attempts an OOS implementation of the methods used in the whitepaper. I examine share buybacks and earnings announcements from 2011 till 2016 finding similar results to the authors with positive returns of 1.115% in a (-10, +15) day window surrounding earnings. Using these results, the folks at <a href="http://quantpedia.com/">Quantpedia</a> and I attempted to craft an example trading strategy that would profit off the positive market reaction that seems to follow earnings reports made after a buyback announcement. </p>

<p><strong>Trading Strategy Details</strong></p>

<p>Looking at a universe of the top 2,000 most liquid securities, the algorithm filters for securities that have announced a buyback [-15, 0] days before an earnings announcements and goes long on that security for either 25 days or 15 days after the earnings (whichever comes first).</p>

<p><strong>FAQ</strong></p>

<p><code>What is the Quantpedia Trading Strategy Series?</code></p>

<p><a href="http://quantpedia.com/">Quantpedia is an online resource for discovering trading strategies</a> and we’ve teamed up with them to bring you interactive and high quality trading strategy examples based off financial research. Our goal is that you’re able to replicate the process we’ve used here for your own research and backtesting.</p>

<p><code>This is a high beta strategy! Why are you posting a strategy that’s long-only?</code></p>

<p>This series is meant to bring you high quality research and trading strategy examples. We plan to release long short, low-beta strategies in the future. For this specific strategy, the share issuance dataset would’ve been needed to create the short portfolio but a possible substitute would be to use negative earnings surprises as the short portfolio for this strategy. </p>

<p><code>Where can I find more trading strategy ideas?</code></p>

<p><a href="https://www.quantopian.com/posts/pipeline-factor-library-for-data">You can find the full Quantpedia Series here along with other curated pieces of research</a>. Other than that, you can browse <a href="https://www.quantopian.com/posts/quantpedia-trading-strategy-series-are-earnings-predictable">Quantpedia’s strategies</a> or look through our forums for ideas posted by community members.

<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>

<p>From <a href="http://quantpedia.com/">Quantpedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The paper states that it is generally accepted that managers have more<br>
information about the firm than investors. Given this information<br>
asymmetry, managers can make informed decisions about corporate<br>
actions such as equity offerings or repurchases. The announcement of<br>
stock repurchase or secondary equity offering is voluntary and can be<br>
easily moved by a few weeks or months. Therefore timing of SEO or<br>
repurchase announcement before earnings announcement could be<br>
perceived as important information about future performance of stock<br>
during earnings announcement period.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While equity issues are not yet available through Quantopian, I find evidence of earnings predictability similar to the authors with positive returns of 1.11% over a 25-day window (-10, +15) for earnings following a buyback announcement. The results hold true for different time windows (0, +15) and sample selection criteria. However, unlike the authors, I find the highest positive returns for earnings that are (5, 15) days after a buyback announcement. Lastly, because the data used in this notebook is up till present day, it may be useful to view this as an &quot;out-of-sample&quot; validation of the authors&#39; original work.</p>

Let&#39;s suppose a company planned to report earnings 5 days in the future, and had a buyback announcement  10 days in the past, and had the most previous earnings report 30 days in the past. Correct me where I&#39;m wrong: since_earnings = 30, since_buybacks = 10, till_earnings = 5, since_buybacks + till_earnings = 15, and &quot;(since_buybacks + till_earnings) &lt;= 15&quot; evaluates to true.  </p>

<p>Thanks for pointing that out. I had posted the incorrect backtest. The version you saw there was one I was researching for reversals in earnings when a buyback occurs after an earnings announcement. It is unfortunately not complete yet but I encourage you to play with it if you want!</p>

<p>The correct version has been posted using <code>since_buybacks + till_earnings &lt;= 15</code>. </p>

<p>Peter,</p>

<p>Could you clone this new algorithm that fixes the issue that Tom has pointed out? I suspect it will be subject to a similar capacity effect however it is the correct strategy.</p>

<p><strong>The backtest is not rendering correctly, the main post has been updated. Please clone that instead.</strong></p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>Could you implement the article&#39;s other claim as well? Regarding &quot;The study documents ... similarly negative abnormal returns for share issues regardless of the earnings themselves.&quot;<br>
Though the authors mention negative returns regardless of earnings, I imagine any trends would be magnified for equity issues shortly before earnings reports. Similar trends might also hold for debt issues shortly before earnings. </p>

<p>While announcing a buyback before earnings suggests management believes share prices will rise, it may also indicate the company is unable to utilize additional capital due to limited growth potential.<br>
But if a company issues equity or debt shortly before earnings, it may indicate management believes share prices/credit rating will fall and that the company needs additional capital to finance debt (debt that will be far more expensive to finance after a bad earnings report).<br>
Given such intuitions, I imagine more consistent profits will be found exploiting the second trend. </p>

<p>It appears the data is available at <a href="https://www.quantopian.com/data/eventvestor/issue_equity">https://www.quantopian.com/data/eventvestor/issue_equity</a>, but not in the pipeline format. An example algorithm using the dataset could be a good tutorial on accessing the Blaze API.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s an interesting hypothesis. At the moment, you could implement the research side of things using the share issues (<a href="https://www.quantopian.com/data/eventvestor/issue_equity">https://www.quantopian.com/data/eventvestor/issue_equity</a>) and be able to take the first step in testing your idea.

<p>As for the orders, you&#39;re probably experiencing slippage. <a href="https://www.quantopian.com/help#ide-slippage">Taken from our help docs</a>:</p>

<pre><code>Slippage is where our backtester calculates the realistic impact of your orders on the execution price you receive. When you place an order for a trade, your order affects the market. Your buy order drives prices up, and your sell order drives prices down; this is generally referred to as the &#39;price impact&#39; of your trade. The size of the price impact is driven by how large your order is compared to the current trading volume. The slippage method also evaluates if your order is simply too big: you can&#39;t trade more than market&#39;s volume, and generally you can&#39;t expect to trade more than a fraction of the volume. All of these concepts are wrapped into the slippage method.

When an order isn&#39;t filled because of insufficient volume, it remains open to be filled in the next minute. This continues until the order is filled, cancelled, or the end of the day is reached when all orders are cancelled.

<p>Thanks for your updates on this topic.  To be clear, which is the &quot;main post&quot;?  It&#39;s a bit confusing because you refer to a &quot;main post&quot; while at the same time posting an algorithm.</p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>Hi Everyone,</p>

<p>I cloned the original algorithm and I&#39;ve made some changes using the <a href="https://www.quantopian.com/posts/optimize-api-now-available-in-algorithms">Optimize API</a>. Let me know what you think.</p>

<p>The essence of the strategy and algorithm remain the same. In this implementation, rather than manually placing orders for securities we&#39;d like to assume positions in, we use order_optimal_portfolio (found in the <a href="https://www.quantopian.com/posts/optimize-api-now-available-in-algorithms">Optimize API</a>) to construct a portfolio. To do so, we first construct a dictionary of stocks and the portfolio weights we&#39;d like each stock to have. This dictionary of securities and weights is used to create a trading objective (through the TargetPortfolioWeights constructor) that we pass into order_optimal_portfolio. After creating a universe of stocks we&#39;re interested in (the stocks we want to go long on), we specify our maximum leverage tolerance as a constraint to this trading objective. Overall, this results in slightly different metrics from the original algorithm. Alpha, beta, and Sharpe Ratio all increase. This is likely due to the leverage constraint we place on our portfolio.</p>
