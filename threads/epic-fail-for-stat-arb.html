<p>Looking at this fantastic blow up, it seems like I should be able to just invert all my orders and have a great winner of an algorithm. Yet, I&#39;m finding it surprisingly difficult to do that!  Still, I keep thinking that reliably bad is just an inverted winner, and there must be a way to take this behavior and profit from it, especially given the steady decline. <strong>Any advice?</strong></p>

<h1>What I did to create this</h1>

<p>After I tried the arbitrage between the <a href="https://www.quantopian.com/posts/ernie-chans-gold-vs-gold-miners-stat-arb">gold commodity ETF and the gold mining ETF in this shared algo</a>, I did more research on the fundamental investment. I read this <a href="http://www.fool.com/retirement/general/2012/06/13/gold-vs-gold-miners-which-is-better.aspx">article on Motley Fool</a>, which described how miners will hedge their commodity exposure, and therefore their earnings do not exactly follow the fluctuations in gold. I thought this could cause the GDX ETF (miners) to be less correlated than a single gold miner. I settled on <a href="http://www.google.com/finance?q=NASDAQ:RGLD&amp;sq=royal%20gold&amp;sp=1">Royal Gold</a>, primarily due to its relatively high trading volume.</p>

<p>I also modified the algorithm to reduce its positions whenever the R squared fit of the model fell below 0.9. </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>@fawce, I wonder how much of your losses are derived from depreciation of your portfolio and how much are simply from frictional costs associated with opening and closing your positions.  If I understand your algo correctly, I think if the spread fluctuated around 2.0 or -2.0 standard deviations, you would end up buying and re-selling the same chunks of stock over and over.  That would also explain why inverting the bets doesn&#39;t change your performance, since you&#39;re doing the same fluctuation except inverted.  </p>

I was worried about the same, seems like I could test it by varying the standard deviation range for buying/selling. My worry is that there is a trend for the spread to continuously widen, which would tend to put the spread at a large delta from the trailing mean. If that is the case, I&#39;m not sure how to make this profitable without just betting the spread will widen.  </p>

.9 also seems like a really high minimum on your r^2 value to reduce your position.  I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if you&#39;re almost always reducing your position every time you buy or sell the spread (which would have the same effect as the price fluctuating around the stddev window)</p>

<p>&quot;Important cases where the computational definition of R2 can yield negative values, depending on the definition used, arise where the predictions which are being compared to the corresponding outcomes have not been derived from a model-fitting procedure using those data, and where linear regression is conducted without including an intercept.

Ah, now this makes a lot of sense. I fixed the if statement on line 170 to be elif, and the algorithm <strong>never trades!</strong> The r^2 guard in the algorithm was meant to protect against the condition you&#39;re describing above - where the assumed relationship between the two instruments proves to be too weak to trade. But with the bug, it was trading both sides of the guard and steadily draining capital in transaction costs. </p>

I think the issue was (at least in part) with your use of statsmodels to build the linear regression.  The OLS model is really meant for more generalized (ie, multidimensional) correlations, and I think it assumes you&#39;ve done some amount of normalization on your data so that it doesn&#39;t have to account for constant factors.  (This is all a bit speculative.  I went and hunted through the statsmodels api reference a bit and found it pretty impenetrable.  I think I&#39;d have to sit down with an applied stats book for a while to properly figure out what&#39;s going on.)  At any rate, since all we&#39;re doing is regressing two different series, a much simpler tool is scipy.stats.linregress.  I ran that against the same data and got much more sensible results:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>2012-01-17 14:31:00 PRINT rsquared 0.018384, beta -0.095647</p>

<p>2012-01-30 14:31:00 PRINT rsquared 0.307240, beta 0.339751  </p>

<p>p2 = [x.price2 for x in self.ticks]  </p>

<p>gradient, intercept, r_value, p_value, std_err =  stats.linregress(p1, p2)  </p>

<p>self.rsquared = r_value **2</p>

<p>self.beta = gradient</p>

<p>This should calculate a linear regression between the price of p1 and p2, such that in the model:  </p>

<p><code>p2 = gradient * p1 + intercept</code></p>

<p>It seems like the rsquared of the model fluctuates wildly as you recalculate.  There are periods in 2006 where you have decent correlation (r^2 hanging out around .6 or higher)  and other periods where it&#39;s less than .01, which would mean that the two sids are moving essentially at random relative to one another.  I think improving on this algo would require figuring out a more reliable way to determine when the integration between the sids breaks down.  </p>

I noticed another difference between this example and the <a href="https://www.quantopian.com/posts/ernie-chans-gold-vs-gold-miners-stat-arb">gld/gdx version</a> - here I am using a bet size of 100 shares, and in the gld/gdx I am using 5 shares. I switched to 5 shares here and got very different results - still not good, but not the grinding pit of despair pictured above. I think the larger betsize increases the slippage and transaction costs to a level that overwhelms the value of the arbitrage.</p>

<pre><code>p2 = sm.add_constant(p2)  
</code></pre>

<p>to add a constant factor of 1, otherwise you are not estimating an intercept (which is why @Scott&#39;s code should have produced something else, I think scipy is estimating an intercept by default). The reason is that statsmodels is estimating the general Y = X*beta + eps model. You want to estimate Y = X*beta + intercept + eps. Thus if you have a column of 1&#39;s in X it ends up estimating what you want.</p>

<p>To get the p-value you have to compute a Student t-test. After after line 103 you can add:</p>

<pre><code>pvalue = results.t_test([0,1]).pvalue

Would say that the intuition is that if you omit the intercept you&#39;re systematically over/underestimating the spread. To illustrate, let&#39;s say the actual model is:<br>
spread = p1 - beta*p2 - alpha<br>
By assuming alpha = 0, you overesitmate the spread when alpha &gt; 0 and underestimate it when alpha &lt; 0</p>

<p>There other things you can do to optimise the spread / zscore:<br>
- using logarithms<br>
- using different window sizes<br>
- using volatility decay - weigh recent history more heavily</p>

<p>I tried logs by cloning your code but somehow it didn&#39;t work very well :) It works in my own implementation though...</p>

<p>Had another question for you - what&#39;s the meaning / difference here:<br>
42. spread = price1 - price2<br>
60. self.spread = data[self.stock1].price - self.beta * data[self.stock2].price  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>@JJ the spread on line 42 is actually not used. Originally, I was calculating the moving average and stddev inside handle_add, and I reorganized the code to do it in the OLSWindow&#39;s handle_data method instead.</p>

<p>I believe the discrepancy in calculation of the spread is a bug - line 60 is the correct calculation, where the spread is being adjusted by the beta from the OLS calculated on the time series from the prices.</p>

<p>For the log, are you taking the log of the prices?  </p>
