As an example of what can be done with the research you find there or anywhere else in the community, <a href="https://www.quantopian.com/users/57daf0f6689a0185340002bf">Matthew Lee</a> created 3 different variations.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a quick summary of the strategies used in this thread:</p>

<ol>
<li> <a href="https://www.quantopian.com/posts/quantpedia-trading-strategy-series-reversal-during-earnings-announcements"><strong>Reversals During Earnings Announcements</strong></a> by <a href="https://www.quantopian.com/users/5739d98eac0bc36c830006a7">Nathan Wolfe</a> - Eric C. So of MIT and Sean Wang of UNC show that abnormal short-term returns reversals take place during the period immediately surrounding earnings announcements. They surmise that this reversal results from market makers&#39; response to a temporary demand imbalance, as they temporarily shift the stock&#39;s price to ride out the imbalance. (Algorithm + Notebook + Tearsheet)<br></li>
<li><a href="https://www.quantopian.com/posts/quantpedia-trading-strategy-series-are-earnings-predictable"><strong>Are Earnings Predictable with Buyback Announcements?</strong></a> by <a href="https://www.quantopian.com/users/51cbb24ab03fe0bc5500000e">Seong Lee</a> - The announcement of stock repurchase or secondary equity offering is voluntary and can be easily moved by a few weeks or months. Therefore the timing of SEO or repurchase announcement before earnings announcement could be perceived as important information about future performance of stock during earnings announcement period. (Algorithm  + Notebook)<br></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.quantopian.com/posts/quantpedia-trading-strategy-series-reversals-in-the-pead">Reversals in the PEAD</a></strong> by <a href="https://www.quantopian.com/users/57daf0f6689a0185340002bf">Matthew Lee</a> - In his white paper &quot;Overreacting to a History of Underreaction&quot;, Milian explores the possibility that well known cross sectional anomalies can reverse over time. Specifically, he investigates the reversal of the PEAD effect. He finds that contrary to previous research, stocks with the most negative previous earnings surprise actually exhibit the most positive returns following the subsequent earnings announcement. (Algorithm + Notebook)</li>
</ol>

<p>You can find the variations attached to this thread. Copy, clone, and enjoy!</p>

<p><strong>Variation 1</strong></p>

<p><code>PEAD Reversal + 5 day returns Reversals Rolling Rebalance</code></p>

<p><strong>Logic:</strong><br>
1. Each day, run a pipeline for stocks, selecting q500 stocks in the top decile of previous earnings surprise (shorts), and lowest decile of previous earnings surprise (longs), and the top quintile of returns, and q1500 stocks in the top decile of 5 day returns (shorts) and lowest decile of 5 day returns (longs).<br>
2. Increment the hold times for each stock held in the portfolio, only keeping stocks for which the hold time &lt; <code>context.days_to_hold</code><br>
3. Open new long/short positions for stocks generated by the pipeline, equally distributing the portfolio between all long/shorts currently held<br>
4. Close positions for stocks which have been held for &gt; <code>context.days_to_hold</code></p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
This algorithm is an implementation of combined strategy using this <a href="https://www.quantopian.com/posts/quantpedia-trading-strategy-series-reversals-in-the-pead">paper on the PEAD Reversal</a> in combination with this paper on <a href="https://www.quantopian.com/posts/quantpedia-trading-strategy-series-reversal-during-earnings-announcements">news driven returns reversals</a>, leveraging the PEAD reversal found after earnings announcements, along with reversals based on 5 day return lookbacks. </p>

<p>*Note that this algorithm uses the <code>LagESurp</code> indicator, rather than the stronger <code>LagEaRet</code> indicator for Earnings Surprise</p>

<p><code>PEAD Reversal Rolling Rebalance w/ Bonds</code></p>

<p><strong>Logic:</strong><br>
1. Each day, run a pipeline for stocks in the Q500, selecting the top decile of previous earnings surprise (shorts), and lowest decile of previous earnings surprise (longs)<br>
2. Increment the hold times for each stock held in the portfolio, only keeping stocks for which the hold time &lt; <code>context.days_to_hold</code><br>
3. Open new long/short positions for stocks generated by the pipeline, equally distributing the portfolio between all long/shorts currently hold<br>
4. Close positions for stocks which have been held for &gt; <code>context.days_to_hold</code><br>
5. Fill the leverage gap between the current leverage and desired leverage with long term bonds </p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong><br>
This algorithm is an implementation of the strategy found in this <a href="https://www.quantopian.com/posts/quantpedia-trading-strategy-series-reversals-in-the-pead">paper by Milian</a>, leveraging the PEAD reversal found after earnings announcements<br>
This algorithm also utilizes long term bonds to fill the portfolio on days with no earnings announcements.<br>
Note that this algorithm uses the <code>LagESurp</code> indicator, rather than the stronger <code>LagEaRet</code> indicator.</p>

Premium datasets provide a free sample period and a time period for which you need to subscribe.  In the case of the earnings calendar from EventVestor, you have free access up to two years ago (2014-12-04 as indicated by the error message). To run a backtest for the time period up to 2016-11-18 as you attempted, you&#39;d need to subscribe to the data set at <a href="http://quantopian.com/data/eventvestor/earnings_calendar">http://quantopian.com/data/eventvestor/earnings_calendar</a></p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>In regards to the paper, &quot;Overreacting to a History of Underreaction&quot;, I am also finding similar results using an event study. Yet, I would like to ask the question on the proper way to do the events study. The way I have done it is by aggregating through 2 dimensions: cross sectional aggregation and time aggregation. For example:</p>

<pre><code>&quot;-1 days&quot;   &quot;0 days&quot;    &quot;+1 days&quot;  
</code></pre>

<p>firm 0  -1.0%        10.0%            2.0%<br>
firm 1  0.0          -5.0           -1.0<br>
firm 2  0.0            12.0          3.0<br>
firm n  2.0            -6.0        -2.0<br>
AAR <strong>0.3       2.8                 0.5</strong><br>
CAAR    =3.5 %<br>
Day 0 is the earnings announcement date.</p>

<p>The abnormal return (AR) is averaged per day across the firms and the CAAR is the sum of the ARs across the 3 days. Does this methodology agree with the group on event studies? If so, I also see a drift, yet to prove if statistically significant, but if earnings surprise is negative and abnormal returns around [-1,0,1] is negative that on average after  5 days the abnormal returns start to drift up. Curious what people think on this?  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>hi, wondering if you can help on events study. Create events window as earnings announcement date +/- extra days. As for as aggregating, I group the firms that have earnings on the same date and calculate abnormal returns say event T. Yet, if the next earnings date is T+1, again, I group the firms that have earnings on the same date and calculate abnormal returns. Yet, if I wanted to get the average abnormal returns, how would I combine these two groups as one to see the event study? The two event windows overlap and combing them I feel would be incorrect? Any suggestions would be useful. thanks  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>I do not have any live algo trading experience, and that&#39;s why I come up with this question. I have 20k in my IB account. I want to revise the above algorithm (say Variation 1) in the post for live trading, here are two questions:<br>
(1) what data shall I subscribe from quantopian at minimum to save my cost? 
(2) If I have not ordered data used in code, does Quantopian platform give a warning when I try to launch it for live trading?</p>

<p>I guess it shall be no problem if I order &quot;pipeline data bundle&quot;, which is too expensive for me. I saw the code importing data from Zacks, and Eventvestor. But, I also do not know which Eventvestor service is particularly needed in this code. Thanks.  </p>
