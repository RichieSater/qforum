<div class='body-text-container post-body'><p>Hello everyone,</p>

<p>We&#39;re shutting down the broker integration feature at the end of September.  Everything else on Quantopian will continue unchanged - Quantopian Research, our backtester, our community, and all of our data. We continue to make <a href="https://www.quantopian.com/allocation">allocations</a> to selected algorithms, and we&#39;re still running the <a href="https://www.quantopian.com/open">Quantopian Open</a> every month.  We&#39;ve already contacted the few hundred community members who use the feature to let them know.  For most of the community, this decision means we can spend more of our time and energy on improving Quantopian.  We will be making it easier to learn about quantitative finance, to research strategies, and perhaps get an allocation.</p>

<p>We thought long and hard before we made this decision.  A key element of our company philosophy is to keep our goals aligned with our community&#39;s goals. This ensures that we&#39;re delivering the best experience and product that we can; we&#39;re working for you, and for us, all the time. At the end of last year that was still true - we were making allocations and trading our company&#39;s capital using the Interactive Brokers integration. Our success depended on the broker integration, and we felt the pain of every limitation and bug in that integration ourselves. </p>

<p>That pain made sure we were investing and improving the integration every day. In April we started trading on behalf of our investment clients using a prime broker, an integration that uses a different codebase. That was the moment when the company goals significantly diverged from the goals of personal traders. Our focus has been on helping the community create high-quality algorithms that we can fund with allocations of millions of dollars, and not on the broker integrations. We have concluded that we can&#39;t support personal trading at the level of quality that you deserve and expect.</p>

<p>Moving forward, we want to help people find other ways to trade their own money algorithmically.  One possible option is the zipline-live open source project that is derived from our open source backtester, zipline. This project has the potential to be an alternative for personal trading. We&#39;ve talked to the project leaders, and we&#39;ve agreed to support the future development of zipline-live.  Interactive Brokers has agreed to provide some assistance as well. We support more than a dozen different open source projects already and zipline-live fits our mission.  We are also soliciting additional corporate sponsors to help support the project.  If you&#39;re interested in using this project for your own personal trading, or in helping to build this project please visit <a href="http://www.zipline-live.io/">http://www.zipline-live.io/</a>.</p>

<p>We launched the Quantopian community in 2012 with just a simple backtester. The feature requests came in fast, and we kept building - first fetcher, and later we added more rigorous alternative data sources. We built broker integrations, history, pipeline, futures, and more. We thank everyone for their help from the bottom of our hearts. The community has pushed us to keep building a high-quality platform. We can&#39;t thank you all enough for believing in us and working with us. </p>

<p>I said earlier in this post that our focus has evolved. Still, I want to repeat that our core principles have not and will not change. We&#39;re here to democratize finance, to educate people from all over the world, to teach about quantitative finance. We are just sorry that we don&#39;t have the resources to do everything we want to. We thank you for all of your support.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>fawce</p>

No, I&#39;m not associated with Quantconnect. This is going to really hurt the community in my opinion. What else will code written on Quantopian be good for except the contest and Quantopian allocations? If you have an algo that isn&#39;t quite good enough to get an allocation, or isn&#39;t what they are looking for, but is good enough to trade you&#39;ll be out of luck I guess.  Betting it all on getting an allocation is a too much of a gamble in my opinion. I&#39;ll probably finish up the contest entries I&#39;m working on and move on for the most part.

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>Live trading on the same backtester platform is one of the major draws of Quantopian. The majority of sophisticated traders will be less motivated to develop on the platform if there is no reward of being able to actually trade what you just created. We could pay for the service, but I don&#39;t think Quantopian is fully focused on enhancing the platform and trading experience. Instead they are more focused on cultivating the hedge fund and recruitment. Paying for a second rate service would not be the ideal scenario. Additionally, Q may find out that recruitment may take a hit without live trading. </p>

<p>Quantopian is still a good backtesting tool and the Pipeline API is extremely powerful, but the live trading was always unstable. This may be a good opportunity for people to start experimenting with the IB API and hosting their own live algorithms or experimenting with other platforms such as Quantconnect, which is more focused on the technology. Feel free to reach out if you are looking to do the same.  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>It is unfortunate to see this go.  I mentioned this before, but I think the live-trading element was an incredibly clever loss-leader for Quantopian to attract and grow their userbase.  It&#39;s what brought me here.</p>

<p>There are some really intelligent and knowledgeable professors of economics and those types participating in the Q Open. I on the other hand don&#39;t come from that background.  So I gotta ask myself, is it worth it spending months on end researching and exploring potential alpha sources on the Q platform when my only chance of getting anything out of it means I need to beat experts in the field (in addition to a whole lot of luck)?  The value proposition for developing on the Q platform is a bit more bleak without the live-trading element.  Put another way, with this change I&#39;m more <strong><em>likely</em></strong> to make money developing my code on another platform where I can live-trade it than I have any chance of getting anything out of Q Open or Q Fund.  Those efforts are no longer unified.</p>

<p>On the other hand, once upon a time I was the CTO of a venture-funded start-up, so I know all about the importance/pressure to keep a singular focus and not spread yourself too thin.  I could see this going either way --  I guess time will tell whether Quantopian just shot themselves in the foot.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t used Quantiacs, but what does Quantopian have now to differentiate themselves from Quantiacs?  With this change it would appear Quantopian has less of a moat, less value proposition over Quantiacs.</p>

<p>So, y&#39;know, I will keep on working on ideas for the Q Open and Q Fund -- the research environment here is amazing -- but now my efforts will be divided instead of unified between two platforms, with putting food on the table (so to speak, via live-trading) necessitating more emphasis -- for now.</p>

<p>Thoughts:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It would be amazing if we could get access to that prime brokerage through the Quantopian platform.  :)   Problem solved, huh?</p></li>
<li><p>There is another platform that supports live-trading: Quantconnect, but they appear to be running on computers from the 80s... ran out of memory trying to backtest their demo &quot;Buy-and-hold SPY&quot; algorithm.  Also, they don&#39;t support Robinhood.</p></li>
<li><p>I&#39;m sitting here on an computer with 64gb ram, 6 cpu cores, and a recent graphics card.  It&#39;s been kind of comical developing on a super slow cloud platform.  I&#39;d love to be running my backtests and live trading locally.  But....</p></li>
<li><p>There&#39;s the zipline-live project.  They don&#39;t have fundamentals or pipeline or Robinhood integration.  Briefly glossing over it I didn&#39;t even see any mention of data.history(). In addition they warned me it would be moderately difficult to get it up and running.  Not encouraging so far...</p></li>
<li><p>It&#39;s not hard to build a live-trading platform.  Problem is the data -- it&#39;s so massive and expensive $$$$$.  Perhaps there&#39;d be enough community interest to build out a &quot;quant collective&quot; platform that solves these issues?  </p></li>

<p>I do believe the real trading integration was a major driver for joining this platform and wanting to get the algorithms to actually work with the intent of allocating ones funds to it. I have invested over 18 months of work in this platform and although I was concerned about the future commitment to this feature I felt your mission for wanting to maintain a level playing field for the smaller guys would win out. This move significantly reduces the value of using this platform specially now we know that at any time you guys can decide to take something else out. Who knows ... </p>

<p>The end of life notice is too short and not respectful of the time of the community members who have to actually figure something else out. Please at least reconsider that while we all figure out what to do !!!  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>I would happily pay a reasonnable monthly fee (10s of $ not 100s)</p>

<p>I wonder if not allowing auto trading is going to drive some people off the site that would otherwise also compete and thus lower the level of the competition or are those different categories of people? I for one was more interested in my own trading but I was on the side developping multistrategy algo that I was hoping to present in the contest at some point...<br>
However the prospect of winning any material money in the contest is not the driving force as it remains tough to win as far as I can tell... now I ifnd myself googling for alternative to Q for my own trading... turns out there are not too many good solution out there!<br>
QC is a pain to develop with, you can sorta use collective2 api but its pricey for little added value, I have not tried quantiacs or couldtrader , has anyone good alternative to suggest for my home-grown algos?  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>There is no doubt that this is a devastating loss.  There aren&#39;t (that I am aware) any other places which provided enough cross-sectional (fundamental) data to do stock screens, integrated seamlessly into both a freeform research environment, algo paper trading, and live trading.  Although I was forced to shut off my algos for work last November, I benefited greatly from the workflow, and I will miss it.</p>

<p>That said, this should come as a surprise to very few people.  It was clear that despite all their nudging, many people who were live trading their own accounts were <em>not</em> trading the sorts of algos that Quantopian was interested in financing.  In their business model, that makes them strictly parasitic.  Perhaps they paid their way in terms of contribution to the &quot;community&quot;, or perhaps not.  I suspect that the forums/community add little in the way of concrete long-short algos which are suitable for their fund.  In fact, I suspect that many of the people who are able and willing to write algos which cannot be traded personally yet fit the mold for an allocation do so quietly and with little interaction in public.  </p>

<p>I hope people have some sympathy for how difficult a decision this must have been for them.  At the end of the day, they have to keep the lights on, and they have employees whose livelihoods depend on the business being a success.  Personally I think the &quot;Quantopian execs have turned into plutocrats in penthouses&quot; angle is totally wrong.  They are running a business in a tough year for the industry, and just trying to move forward with a focused plan.  Live IB trading sounds like it&#39;s been a bit of a mess for the last few months, and probably quite a stressful distraction.</p>

<p>Still a terrible shame, though.  Especially the data... I was never much a fan of the Python...  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t need anything other than daily price data and stuff I can get from Quandl, so probably a hosted version of zipline would suffice. Then I would not need to recode. I agree with the comments that $10s but not $100s of dollars per month for the platform is comfortable.  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>Even at $150/mo it is nothing vs fund mega millions, there aren&#39;t a huge number doing live trading, although a subscription would reduce the volume level over algos focused on only 1 or a few stocks. 78 messages talking XIV, VXX etc in August alone come to mind. I can&#39;t know how many were just here using a free service without understanding the deal or were (or would become) also interested in the fund or contest, maybe even most, I can&#39;t know, but that type of thing was viewed as a distraction. Also the login issue complaints that were appearing unresolvable disappear. I wonder how many understand the program or sort of view it as a birthright utility.</p>

<p>Since Jan 2014, I lost some money on IB, have an RH algo that has tripled in 9 months and is running ~75% or so of parallel paper trading. 4M in ~5 years in a backtest so it looked great, had hopes for my future in it. 2678 algos stored locally (many are modifications of each other), major investment of life, time. My RH code was the best return so far even tho the time invested was relatively tiny, for example ...</p>

<p>Today 17 tabs open running variations of code toward potential contest entries or fund candidates (just finding it really tough at 10M), so even though the fund has been my main focus, on this sudden loss of real money trading, can&#39;t process it, except maybe with rough thoughts like wondering whether freeloaders ruined some things, I don&#39;t want to characterize them that way, I&#39;d like to think all users arrive with an innate sense of fair exchange, reality, yeah maybe not so much or I don&#39;t know.  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>For some slower strategies (monthly or quarterly), one can still do it manually by live paper trading I assume?  So not a total loss considering we&#39;ll still have access to a lot of fundamental data.</p>

<p>And I do see why they may have wanted or needed to make this move.  But I would have thought a migration to github for a lot of the code that they don&#39;t need anymore would have been a nice gesture, and one that wouldn&#39;t have taken too much time or support?</p>

<p>Still though...  I think they missed a key element, many of us came to this platform to use live trading first, then we started experimenting with developing market neutral strategies. It wasn&#39;t the other way around. So by now discontinuing that service they will shut off a key driver of user growth and therefore of viable algorithm development growth.  </p>

However, I did try to contribute to the forums and answer questions when I had time. It&#39;s unlikely, but possible, that my contributions aided someone that wrote a contest winner, or a helped a future contest winner. Further, I was only a parasite to the point that I still had a lot to learn to develop a strategy, and write an algorithm that would be worthy of, and eligible to enter into the contest, but I had a desire to do so. That being said, they are providing extremely short notice at the expense of those who helped build their business.  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>I would love to be able to read between the lines of this announcement. There might be different reasons for this decision.  Quantopian knows this is going to be a though hit to the community and if they are willing to accept it  either Quantopian business is going so well they can focus solely on what they need without caring about the community (I doubt it) or, more realistically, they have limited resources and they have to focus only on what is essential to their business because they are facing dire straits. If so,  I wonder if the next step is Quantopian shutting down. I know there have been so many announcements about $250M of Investment and Multi-Million Dollar Allocations so that everything seems fine, but you never know  what really happens behind the door.  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>I agree with the gist of the comments made here:</p>

<p>1) there is no reason Q should support live trading algorithms that don&#39;t contribute to Q&#39;s bottom line for free. Startup businesses are tough and burn money fast. Q is just as susceptible to this as the next outfit, and it is completely understandable that they must operate in a cash flow positive way.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>however why not offer a subscription fee that includes the cost of supporting logins, code changes, etc?<br>
  By doing so Q is amplifying its reach into the world of quants, and possibly involving that rare programmer who may contribute to their best<br>
  algo solutions.  Moreover, Q is thereby remaining much more VISIBLE to quants and financeers worldwide. For example, while laboring to develop algo worthy of winning one of the prizes, I was always amenable to the idea of running real money through a proven Q app and paying the 2%/20% fees inherent in that. Granted I am a small player, managing a measly $7 million in capital, but multiplay that by several 100 other RIA&#39;s lurking in the background, and you are talking real money. </p>

<p>Of course I can keep programming away for the sake of the simulated trading environment. Except that I would be hesitant to do that, as we know how different real live trading can be from simulations. </p>

<p>I cannot imagine that that would take more than the efforts of 1 full time technical person at Q. Assuming a salary of 80k a year, and dividing that<br>
  by 5000 plus users, it seems the cost of that would be relatively trivial. Add to that of course the costs of the data feed. How about it Q? What is a reasonable cost for such a monthly service?<br>
to permit (e.g extra 30 days seems reasonable) migrations to other platforms  / languages that<br>
  permit migration to other interfaces/solutions ks to IB and Robinhood. Thousands of programmers have contributed months, and in my case years  of their programming time helping Q members achieve this  record-setting trading environment. They should not be hung out to dry.</p>

<p>I trust the Q team is not out to harm the thousands of programmers who believed in their model and gave it their all. So I am anxious to hear in the next few days what path to a better transition they are able to offer that provides a &quot;win/win&quot; for all concerned.  </p></li>

<p>“Every time I read a management or self-help book, I find myself saying, “That’s fine, but that wasn’t really the hard thing about the situation.” The hard thing isn’t setting a big, hairy, audacious goal. The hard thing is laying people off when you miss the big goal. The hard thing isn’t hiring great people. The hard thing is when those “great people” develop a sense of entitlement and start demanding unreasonable things. The hard thing isn’t setting up an organizational chart. The hard thing is getting people to communicate within the organization that you just designed. The hard thing isn’t dreaming big. The hard thing is waking up in the middle of the night in a cold sweat when the dream turns into a nightmare.”

<p>Prior to this, you had a crowd of people live trading and backtesting in order to live trade, sharing their knowledge and strategies which helped the people making algo&#39;s for the fund. Now you will only have contest algorithms, but barely any users left to collaborate with and draw from. I&#39;ve been at this a year and I know there is hardly any chance of getting ranked in the contest or getting picked for an allocation due to their very institutionally driven rules so why would I even bother attempting? Why would anyone other than a few ultra-knowledgable and ultra-dedicated people even attempt it? Surely quantopian as a fund will suffer.  </p>

<p>I have a suggestion for people who are panicking.  If your algo isn&#39;t terribly time-sensitive (which I assume most here aren&#39;t), why not just paper-trade your algo and use something like Monkeyscript to scrape the trades as they happen 15-minutes delayed (perhaps you can even compensate for it), and execute those trades via whatever brokerage API endpoints you wish to use?  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>I don&#39;t understand why Quantopian wouldn&#39;t have looked to sell or partner with another company to use their live trading feature and support it?  Namely, wouldn&#39;t Robinhood find this aligns well with their business model?  Maybe Quantopian is hoping to get us riled up and therefore use that as a bargaining chip to help sell something they&#39;ve already developed?  Maybe QuantConnect would be interested in purchasing this and/or integrating it into their platform?</p>

<p>If you do the math, there are probably somewhere on the order of 10,000 users that would be interested in paying $200 a year?  That&#39;s $2M a year of revenue that could be paying out right now.  And presumably the base of users has been growing and would continue to grow.  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>Thank you all for replying.  Your passion shines through, and I appreciate it. </p>

<p>Several of the replies we got today asked about whether it would help if we started charging for the service.  Unfortunately, that wouldn’t solve the problem.  One of the big reasons we’re making this choice is so that we can focus on our business: helping thousands of people each month learn about quantitative trading, teaching them about statistics and signals and coding, and rewarding the best of their ideas with prizes and allocations.  We can do that more, and better, if we improve our focus.  </p>

<p>Some people ventured estimates of the size of the personal trading business.  We only have a few hundred people trading real money.  If we started charging $20/month (suggested earlier in the thread), and every single person agreed to pay, it would only be a fraction of the total cost.  I just shared a longer version of this answer <a href="https://www.quantopian.com/posts/live-trading-shutdown-alternative-let-us-pay-you#599cb0637096ca43d85fe2fd">here</a>.</p>

<p>Several replies were about alternatives, and there were several reasonable ideas kicked around.  I suggest looking at <a href="http://www.zipline-live.io/">http://www.zipline-live.io/</a>.  Here at Quantopian we are making continuous investments in zipline, and zipline-live can naturally piggy-back on those improvements.  We have seen the power of open source at Quantopian.  I am hopeful that the time and energy that people have poured into their algorithms can spill over into zipline-live.  With your excitement and skill, zipline-live might be the replacement that so many people here are looking for.  The maintainers of zipline-live can better answer questions about how to integrate data sources, add pipeline, and important details like those.  </p>

<p>A few people asked about what Quantopian does other than brokerage integrations. Quantopian is the biggest community of quants around, and most people come here to learn.  We provide tutorials, lectures, tools, and tons of data.  For some people who use Quantopian, it’s about working on an idea that might someday get an allocation.  I write this paragraph to extend perspective, not as a solution. </p>

<p>I want to close by repeating fawce’s thanks from before.  You’ve all pushed us to make Quantopian a great platform, and you’re still pushing us.  Thank you, all, very much.  Ending this feature is very hard for us.  Many of you had kind words for us in this thread, and understood how hard this is for us, and I thank you for that empathy.   For many, we know we’re disappointing you, and we are very sorry.</p>

<p>I am saddened by this news. I am going to assume that this decision is final and there&#39;s no going back.</p>

<p>With that said, if anyone has interest in migrating your Python codes to TradeStation or MultiCharts, please email me at: <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f49c9b959a93da9f9b868db49399959d98da979b99"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="4e26212f20296025213c370e29232f2722602d2123">[email&#160;protected]</span></a></p>

<p>I highly suggest checking out EasyLanguage for TradeStation and MultiCharts. You can do a lot of the things you do here on Quantopian with EasyLanguage and it is very easy to learn (obviously).</p>

<p>I also suggest checking out QuantConnect and Quantiacs.  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>I just started to use Quantopian in the past few days and aiming to write my first algo for live deployment. I use R and external data sources and I was just thinking &#39;today&#39; of the value of learning to write &#39;algos&#39; here. With Robinhood, it meant there was an edge for the little guy and strategies not scalable to institutional level or strategies where commissions would erode the edge. All those were possible here, the community seemed good too. However, losing the live trading is a missing chain in the link imho. I am quite surprised that the number of people actually trading live algos is so little, very surprised actually. If it dosnt make economical sense, then heck I can see why you have to do it. It is a true danger now that you may lose many users as they may write scripts in R, python or any other external software / scripting / programming. The major win here or the major win &#39;was&#39; that you could write a script and back test and utilize the same rules live. Excellent..... Very disappointed here, however, maybe something open source like this is an option? who knows but looks like crawling back into my cave. I hear zorro trader has direct broker connections, have to learn their language but might be worth a look.  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>Last thing I&#39;ll say here before I go on with my business, but I believe that your quote &quot;Quantopian inspires talented people everywhere to write investment algorithms&quot; no longer stands true as there is very little incentive for low capital and less experienced traders to actually use this website. Our algorithms serve for very little personal gain after the removal of live trading and the only gain we could possibly seek to make requires your validation, where facts show the chances of actually winning a contest are abysmal, even with an impressive algorithm. Not everyone is capable of developing groundbreaking algorithms, which you guys are indirectly forcing, but everyone is capable of learning something new.  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>My basic assessment here is that Quantopian gave brokerage integrations a try and it didn&#39;t work out.  After 3.5 years of working it pretty hard, publicizing a lot, and even after offering totally free trading, out of 100,000 registered users, only a few hundred are impacted by this change.  If retail algorithmic trading were a way to print money, then I would have expected much greater adoption.  It would seem that the market just isn&#39;t there.  It was a pretty expensive way to get the answer, but I guess that&#39;s for the Quantopian VC&#39;s to decide if it was worth it.</p>

<p>It is a minor disappointment for me, since I do not trade with Quantopian (nor anywhere else, at this point).  I was hoping to make a little money, either with the contest or by getting an allocation, and then put it toward an algorithm.</p>

<p>It would be interesting to know how Quantopian real-money users fared over the last 3.5 years.  It may be that Quantopian, on average, is doing users a favor with this change.  Are there data that could be shared?  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>My 2cts: People are motivated by different things, but greed is a very important one. Applause another one. To be honest: I&#39;m motivated by greed, and in my mind, the chance to make money with developing an algo for the contest or fund is rather small, and the potential earnings are meagre, so my best bet was to trade my own algos. I trade depending on the day between 80 and 110k, and my performance is above market with lower risk (known risk aka exposure).</p>

<p>Quantopian would like you to develop high capacity (millions/billions throughput) market neutral, dollar neutral algorithms using datasets other then price/volume, and it happens that if you trade those algo&#39;s with sub 500K, you probably get eaten by the transaction costs and slippage we have on IB and RH. Hence those algo&#39;s are not interesting for me now as I dont trade that much money freely</p>

<p>Hence for me it&#39;s easy: I&#39;m here for my own gain, and my own gain is developing algo&#39;s and deploying real live algo&#39;s that fit my risk profile. So now this unfortunate step makes me think: why would I stay, why would I contribute? Almost no reason to do so except for some research. I might still share algo&#39;s but probably more in the form of notebooks as proof of concept...</p>

<p>What now? @Lecoque shared his libraries, there is <a href="http://IBridgePy.com">IBridgePy.com</a> and there is <a href="http://www.zipline-live.io/">Zipline-Live</a> that probably have the least amount of work for algo&#39;s that have a known set of assets as those algo&#39;s don&#39;t need pipeline. FYI: IB has a limit of 100 assets where you can get realtime quotes for (or pay for more) so algo&#39;s that have less then 100 assets, they are fine.<br>
Or you can go for the other platforms, but they seem to be less advanced and I don&#39;t feel like rewriting 100&#39;s of Algo&#39;s</p>

<p>But this is also a blessing in disguise. The broker integration did not have futures, did not have options and I would love to trade those as well.</p>

<p>Bottomline for me: Fawce, Dan, Delaney: thanks for the ride, I guess this was hard to decide but Quantopian is not democratising the finance industry anymore.... unfortunately.</p>

<p>The thing that is hardest to swallow is the time we get to find another solution: it is way too short and it shows that you guys actually do not respect nor value the community as you claim to do. <strong>PLEASE GIVE US TO END OCTOBER!</strong></p>

<p>I feel a bit betrayed and sad, as I believed in your mission... I guess everybody needs a sucker punch now and then</p>

<p>I&#39;ll share a few more algo&#39;s for the benefit of the community but for the rest: I&#39;m out, no more hours on the forums, no more helping people with Q worthy algo&#39;s<br>
I rather put my energy in zipline-live or other initiatives</p>

<p>@Grant -- coming from a start-up background myself I can tell you that if we had success stories on our platform we did our best to publicize them.  Since they haven&#39;t I think your suspicion may be correct.  :)</p>

<p>I think the reality is -- and you see this in the contest as well -- this stuff is <em>f---ing</em> hard.  It&#39;s surprisingly hard to have a hedged, consistent, low volatility algo that beats the S&amp;P500.  I mean we&#39;re at a disadvantage compared to Wall Street, but look even at hedge funds -- they&#39;re struggling.  Often these funds are losing money right now in a more or less straightforward bull market.  As soon as you remove &quot;market risk,&quot; &quot;sector risk,&quot; etc. you just replace it with alpha-factor risk. That one is really hard to overcome -- an accidental bias or market dynamics shift and all that hedging doesn&#39;t save you.</p>

<p>So I think people must give up when they can&#39;t find anything that backtests consistently well.  Or if they do find something they give up as soon as it fails miserably out-of-sample.  Proper statistical rigour is really really hard.  Or on the flip side, somebody with healthy levels of skepticism may lack confidence to live-trade their algo. And once you factor in slippage, commissions, margin fees, and taxes, well... buy-and-hold VOO or VT might just be the better option.</p>

<p>I&#39;m surprised though.  I have seen some really promising looking algorithms in these forums (and I assume there are a lot of people who wouldn&#39;t dream of posting their most promising algos -- I know I haven&#39;t).  But you see some of these great algos and they&#39;ve been cloned hundreds of times.  I would have thought there&#39;d be an army of lurkers somewhere live-trading these.  I&#39;m surprised to hear there are only a couple hundred.   Maybe 200 is the total intersection of world population, python programmers, interested in the stock market, and clever.  :)</p>

<p>@Stephen Hanly  -- to the contrary, my experience was that Robinhood was adamantly against in helping me get a second account running for use with Quantopian.  I mean here I am trying to deposit a hundred thou into their platform, and they&#39;re just like <em>no</em>.  Don&#39;t know what&#39;s up with Robinhood, but I did not get a good vibe from them.  </p>

<p>Interesting.  But those are just the attributes required for successful Q hedge fund algo writers.  I&#39;d think that in order to attract prospective fund authors, it would have been a plus to offer the trading platform, but I guess it didn&#39;t work out that way.  There had been so much interest in futures, then they come, and poof!  Odd.  I&#39;d think it would be in the elemental nature of serious traders to want to use the platform with their own capital, and also try their hands at getting a Q fund allocation.  It seemed like a winning combination.  Overall, given only 200 real-money traders, it suggests that the present pool of serious Q fund algo authors is rather small, but it is not clear that dropping broker integrations will help the numbers grow.  </p>

<p>Quantopian has positioned itself as a crowd sourced hedge fund and moved away from the broker model. Why would a hedge fund provide brokerage services? </p>

<p>Secondly it is not difficult to get an allocation and the allocations are not 500k but millions of dollars which means a decent share of the profits. I hope that now that they are more focused we will see better opportunities for some of us who are keen on making a career in quant finance by introducing new datasets, improving speed of backtests and more tutorials on clustering etc.  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>Why do I feel like this isn&#39;t adding up? The entire notion of algorithmic trading is to be able to utilize the algorithm. What drove people to learn the platform in the first place was the ability to identify strategies where they could invest their money, and have a computer, which is far more disciplined, execute a specific strategy. This is beyond stupid, and no rational business person in their right mind would make such a decision, unless there was something else behind the scenes that we&#39;re not being told. I see this as akin to the pattern day trading rule. They say it&#39;s designed to help the average consumer not get taken advantage of, but the reality is it&#39;s designed to limit average consumers ability to profit from the market, because any idiot with half a brain can beat the average annual 6% return. You guys totally sold us out! I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the other sites were next. &quot;Level Playing Field&quot;, yeah right. You know the day you set out to do that you would be a target, and instead of standing up for the little guy, you totally sold us out.

I beg to differ, the threshold is pretty high and although I wrote 100&#39;s of original algo&#39;s, none were selected, but maybe you can help in the true spirit of communty: can you share an algo that has the basis of something that could attract an allocation? There have been only a few allocations and there are 100&#39;s of live traders and 1000&#39;s of tinkerers... the % of success is pretty small</p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>A monthly fee or even a percentage of our profits would acceptable if live trading with Robinhood was possible. I am in the process of learning right now but definitely want to put my money into any algorithm I develop that does well. The criteria for getting an allocation for your algorithm is very restrictive (although I see why Quantopian would want it that way). For the moment I would be happy with any algorithm with decent alpha. A longer term goal would be to develop an algorithm that could get an allocation. I don&#39; think there is much in it for me anymore if I can&#39;t try to profit with my own money until I figure out how to make an algorithm that gets funded. I am realistic in that it will take me a while to become an algorithmic investing genius. I can&#39;t risk my time and effort to something that has such an uncertain return. I make decent profits in manual investing. I believe in the long run I could make an algorithm that fits Quantopian&#39;s requirements, however, why risk trusting them? This is a major change in their promise. How do you even know they don&#39;t use some people&#39;s algorithms without paying them? They have to do what is good for their business but we have to do the same. There is simply too much risk for any beginner to commit time to Quantopian now.  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>While I am also very disappointed in Quantopian&#39;s decision, I think we all have to accept that Quantopian is a financial enterprise.  Having 300-400 accounts at USD 30 per month just doesn&#39;t make sense for any business, especially if there&#39;s no real growth relative to the effort and resources put into it (just take a look at how much a good programmer is paid in Boston).</p>

<p>I agree that 5.5 weeks isn&#39;t enough time for most of us to properly test migrated code (I would have thought that a minimum of 2 weeks of paper trading and 2 weeks of trading with small money would be required before safely redeploying full capital). I have played around with Zipline-live and I have installed it with little difficulty on Mac OS X. Looking at Github, main limitations currently seem to be:</p>

<ul>
<li>limited to having no pipeline (a workaround is in the works but it may not be ready by October 1st)<br></li>
<li>limited to 100 tickers (I believe you can pay IB to increase your data priviliges)<br></li>
<li>multi-account support doesn&#39;t seem to be there yet (this is a problem for those with F accounts)</li>
</ul>

<p>Anyhow, I think most us need to move past the bitterness displayed in some of these posts, and find the best way to move forward in a productive manner. Zipline-live is the clear way forward. We should be in able to get something that can run our existing code with minimal changes. This would allow us to continue using the Quantopian Backtester to test new strategies, paper trade them for a few weeks on Quantopian, and then redeploy them with minimal coding changes on local instances of zipline-live. </p>

<p>Of course, running a cloud-based solution was super convenient, and problems were quickly dealt with by Quantopian&#39;s team. We will now have to double check that our connectivity and algos are running properly every time the market opens. Frankly, this is not a big deal.</p>

<p>I run 2 real money IB accounts traded though Quantopian. My plan is to buy 2 mini PCs for USD 100 each (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Azulle-Quantum-Access-Windows-storage/dp/B00X4O6GRK/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1503469611&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=azulle">https://www.amazon.com/Azulle-Quantum-Access-Windows-storage/dp/B00X4O6GRK/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1503469611&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=azulle</a>) and install python2/virtualenv/zipline-live on them. These mini PCs take no space, consume virtually no energy and they seem relatively stable (they are slow and have very slow write speeds, but that&#39;s a trade-off I can live with). If such a solution works, it will be relatively inexpensive and hassle-free to run your own algos with zipline-live...  </p>

The reason why i am asking is : I try to open a new account at interactive broker and i know that we need to pay for market data fee in case i need real time market data.  Without paying such fee my stock quote will be in &quot;delay&quot; mode.  So i am just wondering how zipline-live can provide real-time market data ?  Also, what is the coverage at zipline-live ?  Only US stock ?  How about CMEGROUP, currency, gold/oil ..etc ?  Thanks.  </p>

<p>Like Quantopian, Zipline-live doesn&#39;t provide any real-time data. Historical daily data can be pulled from a variety of free sources (quandl, yahoo finance, google finance etc), Real-time data needs to be bought from the broker in any case (no free lunch).</p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>@Tony Chang and @Luca, it looks like all the morningstar stuff (fundamental data and all Q500US and Q1500US universes) are not going to work on zipline-live. Looking at the Github pages, they are working on a pipeline workaround where you will be able to download all the tickers for a given exchange, and then set filter parameters (e.g.: moving average of dollar volume) to filter out illiquid names from the pipeline output dataframe. I&#39;m not sure this will be ready by October 1st, and in any event it will represent a change in code logic that will require a period of testing/debugging to adapt to zipline-live.</p>

<p>Interactive Brokers do have APIs to call some fundamental data (<a href="https://interactivebrokers.github.io/tws-api/reuters_fundamentals.html#gsc.tab=0">https://interactivebrokers.github.io/tws-api/reuters_fundamentals.html#gsc.tab=0</a>) but I don&#39;t know if historical fundamental data is available.  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>Very frustrated. Just started a month ago. Hopefully I&#39;ll be able to make the transition to zipline-live, but without RH integration it&#39;s fairly useless to me as-is, so I&#39;m hoping a LOT of angry people jump into development and speed it forward as quickly as possible. I would also have supported paying Quantopian, but I guess it isn&#39;t worth their time.</p>

<p>It would be really, really great would be if Quantopian could detail further what they meant by &quot;We&#39;ve talked to the project leaders, and we&#39;ve agreed to support the future development of zipline-live.&quot; I&#39;d honestly like to see a commitment from Quantopian to help zipline-live get as many of Quantopian &#39;s features as possible operational ready by the time Quantopian  shuts down brokerage integrations. If you can do that, it&#39;d be a relatively seamless transition and zipline-live developers could add additional features after that on their own in the future based on the support that Quantopian provided in getting them up to speed.  </p>

<p>And frankly, a ~30-day shutdown window is a bit short. Not that I expect anyone (in any industry, ever, anywhere) to admit mistakes or change decisions based on user input, but Quantopian should seriously consider extending that to give zipline-live more time to rapidly develop, especially if Quantopian weren&#39;t actually serious about supporting their development.  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>@ Fawce, Dan Dunn -</p>

<p>Presumably, you are still using a feed from <a href="http://www.nanex.net/NxCore/NxCore.htm">NxCore</a>, and will continue to use it for the Q fund?  Do you see any path to supporting the crowd with the tools to create a zipline-live compatible OHLCV minute bar feed?  Would you be willing to open-source your injestor architecture and code?  Or maybe even supply the feed (with a volume discount passed on to the crowd)?</p>

<p>I&#39;m just wondering if there is any path at all for your abandoned crowd to obtain their own 1:1 compatible data, so that Quantopian research/backtesting/paper trading could be used, and then the algo ported over to zipline-live?</p>

<p>By the way, although I&#39;m sure there were compelling reasons for the short notice, 30 days notice is pretty short for such a major move.  Without additional background, I&#39;m compelled to preach.  In the business world, you&#39;ll have trouble if you continue to apply this approach to stakeholders (e.g. Q fund &quot;managers,&quot; VCs, Point 72, prospective customers, vendors, etc.).  You&#39;ll get a bad reputation and folks won&#39;t want to do business with you.  Let&#39;s say you allocate $50 million to a user algo, things are going great, and then the author decides to pull the plug, with only 30 days notice?  You&#39;d likely not want to work with that guy any more.  It does feel like certain elements of the Golden Rule were overlooked here.</p>

<p>On a separate note, it is perplexing that the retail trading industry is huge, yet there is no market for enabling retail traders to do a bang-up job of it.  I think this was the vision expressed in Fawce&#39;s <a href="https://blog.quantopian.com/quantopian-manifesto/">Quantopian Manifesto</a>.  Build it and they will come.  Make the market.  Maybe the market is primarily gambling?  The idea of thoroughly researching a strategy, coding, debugging, and deploying, doing out-of-sample paper trading, etc. just doesn&#39;t work at the retail level?  I&#39;d think that IB and RH would be super disappointed, but maybe they already understand that the upside potential is just not there.</p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>For any IB users who are disappointed by this news, please check out the platform <a href="http://www.ibridgepy.com/">IBridgePy</a>. It is a platform that (judging by the name) bridges IB with a python program that you build, compile, and run on your own machine. This eliminates a lot of Quantopian&#39;s fundamental problems and gives you much tighter control of what goes on in your algorithms.</p>

<p>Also, it has a &quot;run like Quantopian&quot; mode that uses Quantopian&#39;s clock rules and whatnot. The main advantage of this is being able to write and backtest code in Quantopian&#39;s web client, then copy/paste the code into IBridgePy.</p>

<p>It is still fairly new and in active development, so it probably is not without its bugs. But honestly, it&#39;s the next best thing in my opinion. Only big drawback is that you need a dedicated, on 24/7, machine to run it if you want to live trade.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t really see the point of maintaining a connection with Q anymore. I always assumed the recommended method for using IB as a live trading platform was to maintain two connected IB accounts, one as the &quot;live trader&quot; (which handles the money) and one as the &quot;observer&quot; (which merely exists so that you can logon and use your IB account to its full advantage). If you don&#39;t have an observer, you can&#39;t logon to IB for any reason without disconnecting your live trader.</p>

<p>Quantopian is (was) able to act as the observer, but it was very limited in terms of what it could look at, in my opinion. IBridgePy is a very, very good solution as long as you are willing to put in the extra work.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know much about zipline-live, but in the small snapshot I&#39;ve got of it from this thread, it seems much more limited than IBridgePy.</p>

<p>IBridgePy will let you look at <em>any</em> ticker (stocks, futures, options, forex, whatever) that your IB account has permission to see, and lets you trade using whatever method you want, provided IB TWS has the capability to do so (which it should, because it is a very powerful platform).</p>

<p>There are almost no limitations to what you can do when it comes to IBridgePy. None that I can think of off the top of my head, anyway.  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>Hi John O&#39;Leary , thank for your speedy response.  I just do a quick search on IBridgePy and immediately realize at least on thing it wins Quantopian -  that the Quantopian schedule_function (which is limited to US stock trading hour) is no longer an issue at IBridgePy  ^_^.  This is important in case we trade thing..like CMEGROUP future such as gold  / oil.  Now i have 2 more questions.  As you say, IBridgePy  allows us to trade ANY product that IB provides right...so can i trade Hong Kong stocks  (or even HK index future / option) using IBridgePy ?  Also, do you know whether i can get delayed market data free of charge (or i must subscribe first even for accessing delayed data) ?<br>
Thanks.  </p>

<p>You need to check your IB permissions to see what you have access to trade. If you have the permission to trade and view real-time data for the HK stock/option/future exchange, there shouldn&#39;t be anything stopping you from using IBridgePy to live trade on them.</p>

<p>And to your second question, I don&#39;t believe so. Trying to access data (even if it&#39;s delayed) that you don&#39;t have permission to trade has resulted in some kind of &quot;Lacking permission to view this data&quot; error. There may be a workaround I&#39;m unaware of, however.  </p>

I believe it is great and provides exactly what we need for live trading. I believe the quantopian team is making the wrong decision here in shutting down live trading instead of monetizing their service. I believe many people would pay for broker integration on this platform. I will post a petition and speak with someone in quantopian to see if it is a monetary issue, so if possible we can start a kickstarter/gofundme of sorts and see if they will implement a subscription based platform for us to use. Another possible route is to add a donate option on their website.</p>

<p>There are many avenues they could of taken to continue the service, and it makes me wonder why they haven&#39;t utilized those options. If they shut it down for good, it makes me wonder what their intentions are. Meanwhile, I will look into other alternatives.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s doable if the &quot;trading middleware&quot; between Q and the broker(s) moves to an institutional model of charging 1/2 penny or a penny per share.  The number of live traders becomes irrelevant, but the volume matters.  This is what anyone pays to clear through institutional firms like Goldman, Cantor Fitzgerald etc. It&#39;s a sliding scale based on the client volume and is rolled into the trade cost.  </p>

<p>One would have to understand the volume behind ~200 traders currently using the platform, but it&#39;s definitely possible.  </p>

<p>It would take considerable effort to get Zipline-Live to that stage, but perhaps Q would partner in such a venture with the contribution of existing code base for live trading in return for a split of revenue.  It doesn&#39;t make sense to completely drop something if there is a chance to receive some benefit by licensing it out and not have to expend additional resources.  I think there are some options to explore.  </p>

</blockquote>

<p>In my opinion, no.  Yes, the licensed algos come from a global crowd, but the business is not crowd-based as a cooperative (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative</a>).  The crowd has no power, no right to information, no nothing.  By design, this is how Quantopian is set up and I suspect all other so-called &quot;crowd-sourced&quot; funds are the same.  Until somebody actually sets one up that has a fundamentally different business model, I wouldn&#39;t expect a different outcome.  I don&#39;t fault the Quantopian team and their backers.  They are clever, and know that they could do things differently.  I have to wonder, though, if they fully appreciate the engagement they could have under a true crowd-sourced (i.e. crowd-owned and crowd-controlled) collective effort.  Leveling Wall Street needs to start with the fundamentals of the business that intends to do the leveling.  One draw to Quantopian for me was the hope of not working for The Man (I do that already), but that isn&#39;t working out so well.  Everything seems strongly vectored in the opposite direction.  </p>

<p>Good points. From what I could gather by looking at other similar ventures, there is some <em>serious</em> red tape in regards to the world of hedge funds and how they take and disperse money to their investors, especially if most of their clients are small-time. Makes a more discretely-managed fund hard to create. &quot;Leveling Wall Street&quot; isn&#39;t going to happen unless the regulations change. </p>

<p>Even so, I&#39;m confident that some new business will emerge that will make better use of crowd-sourcing algorithms for profit, with hopefully a more attractive start than Quantopian. I agree with Grant, I don&#39;t like the direction this is going.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: I don&#39;t doubt that Quantopian is going to be wildly successful. It&#39;s just not what I&#39;m looking for anymore.  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>The decision Quantopian made is a very difficult one. But, I think, they had to look at the hard numbers and where they wanted to go. The numbers were not viable. So, they took a step back, paused. They might reconsider later, or permanently accept the change to their orientation. They too have to evolve, do the best they can for their people.</p>

<p>I came back to Quantopian last year for three things. To have access to minute US stock market data at low cost, find people who shared my interest: designing worthwhile automated stock trading strategies, and prove to myself that I could reach higher long term performance levels by increasing trading activity using my methdology.</p>

<p>We all know it takes a lot to design interesting strategies. When you throw them in the data fire, they do not all survive. And whatever strategy is designed, it has no chance of going live unless it has passed our individual acid tests. These all seem to end up with words like: profit, edge, alpha, or this no good gizmo thingy.</p>

<p>We have a research platform, did I say it was free, that allows us to test whatever we have in mind. We have access to extensive historical databases. We can code, within limits, billions upon billions of possible trading scenarios.</p>

<p>I will stick around. Continue to use what is made available. Develop strategies with high potential, put them to the test. Port the EOD scenarios I have developed elsewhere to the minute level. Let those concepts prove themselves, and then find ways to port them elsewhere. </p>

<p>What I want is the methodology, the trading procedures to be implemented. Even if I have to convert them to manual afterwards, at least I would have proven to myself, using the Quantopian environment, that it would have worked in the past for an extensive period of time giving me enough confidence in my work to carry it forward to its logical conclusion. Even if it is on another machine using another programming language.</p>

<p>So, yes, I will stick around, for the time being.  </p>

<p>Guy,</p>

<p>While this is true, it does not need to be exclusive to Quantopian. The only advantage Quantopian has now is that it&#39;s easier to utilize than other methods. If you&#39;re willing to invest time and effort, platforms like Zipline-live and IBridgePy can offer the same exact functionality and more, with the added benefit of actually still being able to live trade, all for free. And if you ask me, the limitations of Quantopian&#39;s platform are too restrictive anyway.</p>

<p>The learning curve is high, but that&#39;s the price that you need to pay. Otherwise, you&#39;ll need to be shelling out actual money for a decent platform that can perform research, backtest, and live trade.  </p>

<p>I dabbled with QuantConnect, but didn&#39;t really care for their platform, but they have the granularity you&#39;re talking about. Quantopian was much better on all counts with what it offered, with the exception of not having second and tick data. They integrate with IB as well, but not with Robinhood, so you will need a much larger sum to begin trading, though I&#39;m not sure about some of the other brokers. Personally, I&#39;m going to go with SureTrader and simply trade the market manually. As far as live trading goes, none of this make business sense. When you have a product that people want, you sell it. You don&#39;t destroy it, unless you have another motive behind what you&#39;re doing. I bet you wouldn&#39;t have to dig very deep to find out the truth, but I could spend that time coding with NinjaTrader or something else. Quantopian id dead, suspiciously just like Yahoo&#39;s historical API. I guess all those sick people who wanted to monopolize data that should be free, and sell it to the public for a profit, actually won over. ;) Let&#39;s all sell our souls for jelly rolls.  </p>

<p>Can we get clarity from Quantopian about what <em>exactly</em> will remain, that is publicly available/exposed, after this change? Some questions to answer (I&#39;m certain this is not an exhaustive list):</p>

<ul>
<li>Will backtesting tools and notebooks still exist?<br></li>
<li>Will there still be the same(as of today) data available in backtesting and notebooks?<br></li>
<li>Will Quantopian Live paper trading still exist?<br></li>
<li>Are there planned changes to remove capability from the Quantopian API (that is not related to live trading with a broker)?<br></li>
<li>Is all that will remain a &#39;community&#39; (similar to Stackoverflow) which is merely a forum rather than a forum AND toolkit?</li>
</ul>

<p>There is some FUD due to the announcement without the clarity of what will still be available to community members.  </p>

<p>You said &quot;The main advantage of this is being able to write and backtest code in Quantopian&#39;s web client, then copy/paste the code into IBridgePy.&quot;.

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>Oh well. I switched to Quantconnect. I can backtest 20 times on futures, equity, forex, and options before I get one backtest in QuantoPain. They allow so many brokers for a small monthly fee, and the great news is you can develop your strategies in C# and Python for free. They only charge like $10 a month for live trading. </p>

<p>You guys inflate your sharpe ratios on backtests to make it look like you can make a bunch of returns. There is no leverage control, and the backtest never included interest on margin. I mean the competition used to have 3x Leverage, I don&#39;t think brokers  allow anything over 2x Leverage.  Beta 0 doesn&#39;t make sense, why would I want to be market neutral when the market has mostly gone up over the last 80 years.  </p>

<p>Anyways, switch to QuantConnect!!! You won&#39;t regret it!  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>I think everybody who is posting about all the extra things Quantopian should do to create complex hacks, stopgaps and workarounds are missing the point.  (Except me when I suggested Q give us access to the prime broker they use, because that would be the most awesome solution.)  They&#39;re not going to spend their time and energy developing a workaround new from scratch that would be harder than simply maintaining the current system. Why would they do that? They are moving on from this so that they can stop spending time on it, not so that they can spend more time on it.  </p>

<p>Quantopian clearly wants a singular focus on the Q Fund here. They see everything else as a distraction.  They&#39;re trying to redefine their userbase and community along those lines.</p>

<p>I think everybody who is being left out of that should just check out QuantConnect.  Sure it&#39;s not a drop-in replacement, but I think for most of the strategies people have been running here, you can replicate the exact same logic there.  Perhaps they can make a deal with Robinhood sooner rather than later and get that integration going. They are also powered by open source, so if anybody wants to contribute a Robinhood integration, that might be all that&#39;s needed to get it going.</p>

<p>zipline-live is less promising.  Depending on your strategy and if you can get the data needed for it, maybe you can get it to work for you.  If your strategy simply works based on daily resolution OHLC bars, it could be fine.</p>

<p>@Daniel Koh, you could write a Greasemonkey script to do that for you from the paper trade console.<br>
@Tim Decker, I think they answered at least half of those questions already. Everything pertaining to the contest and the fund remains.<br>
@Stephen Hanly, I don&#39;t think the live-trading part is that hard.  Sure, it&#39;s a hassle to maintain if the broker keeps breaking things, but getting Q&#39;s current code base for that wouldn&#39;t help with that issue anyways.  The hard part to replicate is the data that drives the algorithms here. That&#39;s an engineering nightmare and prohibitively expensive.  (I also assume that those integrations also involved business deals, which the source code isn&#39;t going to help you with.)  Here is the IB API: <a href="https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=5041">https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=5041</a>  Here is an unofficial Python API for Robinhood: <a href="https://github.com/Jamonek/Robinhood">https://github.com/Jamonek/Robinhood</a></p>

<p>It is a shame Quantopian didn&#39;t spin the live-trading aspect out into a different website -- Powered by the same backend, but with different interfaces and different communities.  Lets face it -- live-trading on Q was just kind of tacked on. There&#39;s so much room for innovation and improvement -- but it was never their focus so it was never properly nurtured.  I think that could explain why after a couple years there weren&#39;t more than a couple hundred active live-trade users.  </p>

Fact is, these guys work really hard to keep us in the dark, because the truth is, this is a multi-billion dollar business. Think about it. You invest your money with a broker, and you&#39;re lucky if you get ten percent, but we all know that we can blow that out of the water now don&#39;t we? So who needs brokers if we all start down this path? This is about money. Huge firms, who shall remain nameless, are replacing humans with machines as we speak, but these guys don&#39;t want us getting rich off our own intellect. Oh no. That would actually &quot;Level&quot; the playing field. Unfortunately for them, they can&#39;t stop us. And no, we&#39;re not going to build algorithms for millionaires and hope they fund us. Let them build their own. Better yet, tell them go find a good broker.  If we can&#39;t profit from our own hard, work, why should we contribute to income inequality without an opportunity to capitalize? Sorry, gotta go blue pill on this one. Your matrix has nothing offer.  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>@ Eric Bell, 3 months ago when i started to learn algo trade, i made a comparsion on both quantopian and quantconnect.  Eventually i picked quantopian because i have zero knowledge on C# &quot;class&quot; (and so C# is too difficult for me to learn).  Correct me if i am wrong.  I believe python is more &quot;conventional&quot; and use the normal programming logic.  C# is something hard for beginners, especially everything is in &quot;class-style&quot; and the programming logic flow is not &quot;sequential&quot; (although i agree that it is even more powerful if we fully understand C#).  However, i believe most algo traders are not &quot;IT guys&quot;.  We want to pay focus on algo rather than learning programming language.  That is, if both python and C# can do the same thing, i prefere to learn python because it is much easier to learn.</p>

<p>So do you feel learning C# is difficult ?  any guidance on such learning ?  i am now struggling in between <a href="http://www.ibridgepy.com/">http://www.ibridgepy.com/</a> and quantconnect.  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>Here&#39;s a proposal community. The API that exists allows you to pull data in &quot;from&quot; a spreadsheet via a URL. If the wonderful folks at Quantopian could spend a small amount of time extending this functionality to allow us to export our pipeline results by posting TO a URL, we could leverage the existing platform by importing the output into our own, and utilizing the data wherever we like. We could run this daily, to extract our securities, import them into our newly created  portfolio management platform, and execute trades, however we like. This way Quantopian doesn&#39;t have to worry about bugs in their code, and we can leverage much of the existing algorithms, that we&#39;ve painfully created for &quot;leveling the playing field.&quot; What say ye gentlemen? This would help you keep your stellar reputation in tact, and your sins would all be forgiven.  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>@Tony Chang --  My experience with Python is limited to Quantopian, but I will agree, as it is typically used here it&#39;s linear, or what is called &quot;Functional Programming.&quot;  While this is simpler to learn, the other common technique &quot;Object Oriented Programming&quot; is considered the best practice.  It&#39;s harder to wrap your head around, but in the long run it&#39;s cleaner and more maintainable.  Fear not though, QuantConnect also supports Python, and their platform is pretty similar to Quantopian, and you can code in whatever style you prefer.<br>
@L. Williams   -- nobody need go through all that trouble reverse engineering the Robinhood API.  It&#39;s well documented if you search Google for the Robinhood API, it&#39;s on GitHub.  On your other point, just like you can&#39;t buy an mp3 or a movie and then offer it for free streaming on your website, Quantopian can&#39;t let us stream or download for our own private use the data they&#39;re paying for.  Also, why would they?  If all you need is daily data, you can get it free from Quandl and load it into zipline.<br>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>Thanks again, all, for the replies.  The follow-up <a href="https://www.quantopian.com/posts/phasing-out-brokerage-integrations#599cb101d8a96d001083811d">points I made yesterday</a>  are relevant to some of the replies that came in recently: the importance of focus for Quantopian, the fact we didn&#39;t find a viable business in the broker integration, and, most importantly, our wish that we could support this and our thanks for the community&#39;s contributions.  I won&#39;t repeat those points here at further length.</p>

<p>Several of the comments today talked about how the interest in trading personal capital might translate into algorithms that get an allocation.   Like many of you who posted here, we thought that people who were intrigued by trading their own capital would go on to write algorithms that get an allocation.  Unfortunately, the data doesn&#39;t confirm that. When we tried to figure out why, our conclusion was that the problems are too different.  Personal traders are often trying to capture market effects, like beta-to-spy, that aren&#39;t highly valued by institutional investors.  Personal investors are also optimizing for their account size.  When trading personal capital, people generally write long-only or long-biased algos, and they choose strategies and assets that don&#39;t scale well.  None of these things are &quot;bad&quot; - they&#39;re quite reasonable.  But they are an aspect of our decision to end brokerage integrations.  </p>

<p>I also wanted to confirm that sharing the live data off the Quantopian platform isn&#39;t something we can do.  We license the data from other parties, and that license is limited to the Quantopian platform.  Of course, much of the data we use is available for free, like Quandl and daily price/volume bar data.</p>

<p>A note on moderation: I&#39;ve had to make a few moderation decisions on posts that violate our terms of use.  Please remember that disagreement is fine, but civil tone is important.  I&#39;m also moving this post off the &quot;featured&quot; tab - at 160+ replies, it&#39;s become unwieldy.</p>

How can Quantopian recommend it as an alternative? Unless Quantopian cooperates with them and assists on the development, which I think is highly unlikely.<br>
May be I will have to get back to using  IB API directly as I used to do 3 years ago, given that now IB has a native Python implementation of the API. It is also worth considering deploying algos on amazon servers manually. By the way, QuantConnect is $20/mo (not $10 for the Prime plan, at least this is what I see on the screen).<br>
I still will use Quantopian for backtesting, at least for some time.  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>Dan&#39;s reply actually makes sense, as always. I think the confusion stems from the motives. As a trader/investor, speaking for myself, my motive was to create algorithms not necessarily for investors, but for myself. I&#39;m just being honest. My goal was to turn a small amount of capital into a larger sum by applying technical and/or fundamental trading principles to the filtration and execution of trades. By removing that capacity, it firmly supports Quantopian&#39;s goal, but at the sacrifice of my objectives and others like me, which may actually represent the majority of the user base. To be frank, I don&#39;t know anyone who isn&#39;t, at some level, doing this for their own benefit, even if that benefit is mutual to Quantopian. And honestly, from a business standpoint, I understand the dilemma, but you can&#39;t deny that this is a botched opportunity. I would pose this question. If you quantify the profit generated from the investor base you seek to entertain, and compare that with charging us for the feature of being able to live trade, which has greater scale? You can instantly monetize the platform and charge a monthly fee for what&#39;s currently present. Compare that with waiting for someone to develop the sort of algorithms, you yourself stated, simply weren&#39;t the bulk of what you were receiving. I think you guys should seriously consider what&#39;s on the table, and firmly weigh the risks. As they say in trading, pigs get fat. Hogs get slaughtered. I can&#39;t see any sense in leaving millions on the table, when there is virtually no damage to the goals you&#39;re pursuing. And worse case scenario, you can always decide that the compromise wasn&#39;t lucrative enough to your liking. However, to simply dismiss it, not provide it as an option, and risk a large portion of your user base leaving the Quantopian kingdom desolate, in hopes of new comers jumping on the bandwagon to code more scalable algorithms, sounds questionable, at best. At the end of the day, if this is a business, it&#39;s objective should be to make money. Let&#39;s not kid ourselves. There is no noble cause here. Worse, your competitors will entertain both. That fact alone will kill the platform.  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>Good point L, but in my personal experience, Dan is spot on. The goals and methods of people with the skills and means to trade their own accounts are different from those of the fund. The two sets are very likely completely disjoint. </p>

<p>Writing algos and firing off them into the void in hopes of an allocation is very much a &quot;lottery ticket&quot;, and I personally judged it not worth my effort months ago. I was far more interested in a more certain and reproducible benefit from trading my own account as I saw fit.</p>

<p>It is likely only students and newcomers for whom the lottery effect makes sense, and so by cutting off those of us which were using the system to trade for ourselves, I very strongly suspect they&#39;ve lost nothing in first order effects.</p>

<p>The big question is, if everyone who trades for themselves leaves, what happens to the free flow of information on the boards? Personally, I think that ended with the contests anyway, and the boards haven&#39;t been much use since, so again no great loss there either. </p>

<p>What you are left with, I suspect, is a feeder pipeline of students and dabblers working quietly in isolation developing lottery algos for quantopian, which would seem to be just fine for their business.  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>I agree with Simon. This decision probably makes much sense for Quantopian&#39;s business. Since I joined this platform  I have been asking myself how could Quantopian spend so much resources on tasks that are not their direct goal, the hedge fund. I understood the need of attracting  people with platform  features that were meant to interest and be useful to the users and not the Q hedge fund directly, but it seems that they don&#39;t have the resources for those anymore. Ending the live trading feature means Quantopian is switching to a more selected user base whose intent is learning, researching and trying to build algorithms for the hedge fund. This might be a good move for Q,  time will tell.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t feel betrayed by Quantopian, I didn&#39;t base my choice of using Quantopian hoping in their good intentions, even though their &quot;open to the community&quot; mindset helped a lot. But Q is a business and I am willing to be part of this as long as my goals are aligned with Quantopian&#39;s goals. There is still a lot to learn here and the tools they develop are open source. Also, it&#39;s a good fun trying to write algorithms that move lots of money. Something that I will never (who knows? :) do with my own money.</p>

<p>Shutting down the live trading is mostly a hassle for me, because I will have to spend more time dealing with live trading problem instead of focusing on developing new ideas. if zipline-live was a ready and full replacement for Quantopian platform that would be great, but it is not ready and Dun&#39;s confirmation that Quantopian cannot share their data externally makes zipline-live pointless for me.   QuantConnect is then the natural choice for my live trading, but it will be a pain sharing code between two different platforms. Anyway QuantConnect is very mature and, from the live trading point of view only, it is even more advanced than Quantopian. This is because users live trading is their business, so they keep improving it.  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>I&#39;m in the same boat as Simon when I started, but I did slowly move to make more Qhedgefund type of algo&#39;s where I could switch things on or off (hedging in bull markets is bull imo, dollar neutral is not possibel in Australia with IB, etc)</p>

<p>There are 3 things That annoys/stings me:</p>

<p>1) What stings me is that their <strong>mission</strong> was to democatise the finance world (this part of it) and they can do 2 things: <em>open up their Hedgefund to the community</em> so we can invest (I would hapopy to drop 100K), or allow people to live trade with their own money. How am I going to profit from writing high throughput algo&#39;s suiteable for their fund when the chance to profit from it personally is a lotteryticket?<br>
2) The second thing that I think is just deplorable is the time we get to port. This REAL money, not VC play money, not LP money from Point72: I trade with post tax hard earned dough: you have to respect that and that @JohnFawcett should have fought for, either longer time, help develop an alternative or something else.<br>
3)The third thing is that I actually paid Quantopian for the data use for research/trading, that is now completely useless as I cannot access those datasources myself outside of Q. Thats feels like daylight robery</p>

<p>Finally, when you live trade with you own hard earned dough, you discover that the proof is in the pudding: the executing of the algo is at least as important as the alpha you discover and I had a steep learning curve. I suspect the algo&#39;s published by non-traders, students, punters, etc will be less likely to hold up in real trading and therefor this community will be less relevant for me.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll hang around to find a solution but after that I will be  a real leach: using the datasets for research and like that.  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>Interesting that there isn&#39;t much overlap of folks wanting to trade their own money, and those who show potential for writing Q-fund-worthy algos.  It is &quot;systematic&quot; market speculation versus sober, risk-managed large portfolio construction, along the lines of <a href="https://blog.quantopian.com/a-professional-quant-equity-workflow/">A Professional Quant Equity Workflow</a>.  The retail traders with dopamine addictions probably aren&#39;t the ones interested in doing the latter work with little or no reward (the contest ranking is really the only virtual &quot;warm fuzzy&quot; feedback, but it is not the same as the psychological risk/reward of trading one&#39;s own money).</p>

<p>Part of the problem, in my opinion, is that as Simon points out, it feels like a winner-take-all lottery (&quot;Imagine...you could be allocated $50M!&quot;).  There&#39;s no way to make individual, incremental contributions and get paid in proportion (unless one is actually employed by Quantopian).  And there&#39;s no way to invest in Quantopian nor the fund.  And the latest twist is that one is supposed to use data that is not available up to the present for development!  And even though it was reported that it is very common (and presumably profitable) for hedge funds to use mean-reversion algos, apparently, there&#39;s limited interest on the part of Quantopian for such algos (at least that&#39;s the message I think I got).  I&#39;m not sure if &quot;lottery&quot; is the right metaphor, since based on my recent experience, it&#39;s impossible even to get feedback to find out if one has lost (i.e. the algo has no hope for an allocation).  At least with a lottery ticket, one gets &quot;Sorry, you are not a winner this time.&quot;  I&#39;d agree that it is way too much of a void; there&#39;s a lot of room for improvement in this area.</p>

<p>I&#39;m curious about the reported recent challenging environment for hedge funds.  Might this be impacting Quantopian?  Certainly if volatility is low, some strategies will suffer.  But then, if the market is steadily going up, with low volatility, wouldn&#39;t that be the time for institutional investors to load up on hedge funds (since volatility will inevitably come back)?  Wouldn&#39;t they be re-balancing to maintain their allocations in a steady bull market, so hedge funds would see inflows (even though hedge funds aren&#39;t posting high returns)?  Or do institutional investors chase returns, just like retail folks?  I guess if Q is seeing flat real-money returns, it is hard to make the case that when volatility comes back, the fund returns will turn up.  They need the real-money out-of-sample data, when the market turns down, and hedge funds do their job for institutional investors in smoothing out market roughness.</p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>Disappointing doesn&#39;t really even begin to cover it. This sentiment was voiced earlier and I second it.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been an active member of the Q community forums for awhile now, but now saddened to say I&#39;ll be leaving because of this decision.</p>

<p>Q now boils down to a contest and a long shot allocation. It &#39;s now based solely on competition. Communities are not based upon competition but rather on collaboration. There is zero incentive for me help other members because it&#39;s now a zero-sum game. If someone else wins that means I loose. Having the potential for live trading allowed me to benefit independent of any contests or allocations. Collaboration, communication, and help was a win-win. I could always benefit even if helping someone win a contest. No more.</p>

<p>So long (and thanks for all the fish).</p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>My comments on difficulties hedge funds are facing is based on articles like this that keep making the rounds as of late : <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/jason-karps-tourbillon-hedge-fund-q2-letter-on-quants-passive-2017-8">http://www.businessinsider.com/jason-karps-tourbillon-hedge-fund-q2-letter-on-quants-passive-2017-8</a></p>

<p>Dan has a good point--and it&#39;s only supported by a lot of the comments here --about the disjoint between allocation-worthy algos and live traders. Looks like indeed lots of people are one or the other. </p>

<p>Question now moving forward is, how does Quantopian avoid becoming the Uber of hedge funds?</p>

<p>Uber is of course notorious for creating a technology platform that revolutionized the ride hailing industry by essentially  crafting a novel way to exploit drivers.  I&#39;m hoping that with this new regrouping Quantopian can focus on better ways to incentivize and nurture their coders. (Something more than a lottery and free job training.)  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>@Dan Whitnable - thank you for your incredible contribution to our community. All the disappointment in this thread has been hard to read, but your message hit me the hardest.</p>

<p>I take responsibility for disrupting our community. As many in the thread have said, endowments, pensions, and other institutions face a very different investment problem than individuals. </p>

<p>There was a long and intense debate inside Quantopian, and ultimately I felt I had to mandate our focus on the institutional investment problem. As a kid, I won scholarships to go to high school and college. I&#39;m deeply grateful there were endowments with investment managers planning for my future. That&#39;s why I feel that focusing on the institutional investment problem is such important work. I believe it is my purpose, and I want it to be Quantopian&#39;s. I also think it is one of the biggest business opportunities in history. </p>

<p>My vision for Quantopian&#39;s technology is to create THE platform for the institutional investment industry. A key part of becoming a platform is cultivating experts like you. That means we need to teach the Quantopian community about the problems institutions face, so you can help solve them. Everything in our product -- tutorials, references, examples, our APIs, the data we integrate, and the incentives we provide -- needs to support and reinforce solutions to institutions&#39; problems. </p>

<p>So what&#39;s in it for you?</p>

<p>The entire asset management industry is experiencing an existential crisis. Over the next 5 years, I expect every investment business to undergo a technology dislocation. Some already have. Quantopian&#39;s mission is to catalyze that transition with our platform and our user community. </p>

<p>If we execute properly, Quantopian will be THE platform for asset management. I feel confident saying the economic benefit to you, as a community member, will be far higher with our focus on institutional investing. Your skills will be sought after, even if you never receive an allocation or win the contest. In my view, this is much more valuable to you than taking risk with your own capital.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve been working on many amazing new platform features to go further in this direction. We&#39;ve also been examining the incentives we provide. Clear purpose will allow us to focus on the open problems we have as an institutional platform -- we need to reward more community members and we need to provide more functionality. </p>

<p>Institutional investors need you. I hope you&#39;ll help.</p>

<p>thanks,<br>
fawce  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve asked this question before (<a href="https://www.quantopian.com/posts/investing-in-quantopians-hedge-fund">https://www.quantopian.com/posts/investing-in-quantopians-hedge-fund</a>) but why not look to open up investment opportunities to retail investors for the Q fund?  Wouldn&#39;t that at least provide a means for us to feel better about collaborating and helping one another, if we know it&#39;s in our best interest too because we&#39;ve invested?</p>

<p>I hate the idea of only looking to help the institutional investors, I know they move and control the most money - but <strong>the retail investor needs help too</strong>.  And I fundamentally believe they are more deserving of our&#39;s or anyone&#39;s help.  If there were a means for retail investors (and community members) to have access to the output of our work and contributions to the Quantopian community, I&#39;d think we&#39;d all feel better about helping.  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>@stephen, you voice my feeling well. Let us enjoy the collective work by being able to invest in the fund. I understand that one needs to be a accredited investor....There is really no incentive left for me otherwise. </p>

<p>@ Fawce disrupting the investment industry starts at forcing the players to look at alternatives on how to do things differently. Providing retail investors a way to do it differently would disrupt this industry even faster then etfs and Roboinvestors. Give the community more tools like AI toolkits and access to a prime brokerage would be a way imho.</p>

<p>@quantopian: why do we still have to pay for the datasets? Doesn’t make any sense if one can’t live trade them. Paying a lot of money for gaining a lottery ticket (change of allocation) doesn’t make any sense. I spend around 500$ on datasets which will be useless for me.  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>I have just tried IBridgePy and it seems to really work (with only slightly modified quantopian code) as long as you use data from either IB, yahoo finance, google finance. I would suggest exploring capabilities of pandasdatareader (<a href="https://pandas-datareader.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">https://pandas-datareader.readthedocs.io/en/latest/</a>) for longer term daily data, as IB seems to have an issue with daily data for more than a year using the data.history() method.</p>

<p>This may be a viable option to zipline-live for most algos that are market data based and which trade no more than 100 stocks. The downside with both zipline-live and IBridgePy is that IB doesn&#39;t supply delayed data through their API. You either subscribe to the live data feeds (you probably need both AMEX and NASDAQ subscriptions), or you get nothing.</p>

<p>I think their&#39;s a good chance that both of my algos will be working in 2 weeks time on iBridgePy. Several days of testing will be needed, but I&#39;m more optimistic of being able to make the October 1st deadline.  </p>

<p>So thinking about what quantopian has to offer their user base now -- let&#39;s consider an algo hedged against all the risk factors and displaying no volatility, assuming out-of-sample degradation and alpha-decay  in real life performance you&#39;re not likely to beat SPY&#39; s 8% average return. Let&#39;s say you achieve 5% returns on a $5m allocation.  That&#39;s a theoretical $25,000 cut.  Not bad if you can  with  confidence crank winners like that out on the side. But it&#39;s unclear what percentage of algorithms will get allocations. Depends also on market dynamics not shifting -- so quite a bit of luck. Hard to tell what the odds even are.    But you have to divide that $25000 by whatever you guess your odds are and from there compare it to how much time you think you&#39;ll need to put into research and development on the q platform and ask yourself, is this even minimum wage?  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>I echo the sentiment regarding the retail investor needing more help. Quantopian was an easy bridge for the retail investor to begin trading algorithmically.<br>
Learn from Quantopians API/ tutorials, community and get to competing. Often there are bigger hurdles for the retail investor due to high quality data being expensive, depending on back ground, difficulty with programming. Even those two points alone, Quantopian helped dramatically with the process. It kind of gave power to the little guy.  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>Hi Fawce -</p>

<p>I guess I&#39;m just not getting it.  You seem to have a vision that Quantopian will somehow be different, but its the people and their collective power that will make a difference.  This new-fangled Internet thing gives you access to the global community, and it is a golden opportunity to do something fundamentally innovative as a business, to be refreshingly transparent, and solicit user input and approval at every turn.  Have public-facing change and bug logs, establish a process for request for comments, publish minutes of your meetings with VCs and existing and prospective investors, publish the fund performance, and the list goes on.  And when folks say, &quot;Hey, I&#39;d like to invest in the fund&quot; actually task a regulatory expert to provide some options for discussion.  You need to think how you&#39;d like to be treated, what voice and real influence you would want to have if you were on the other side.  I don&#39;t think you want to be the Uber of finance, as someone commented above.  So think about what you could do differently so you don&#39;t lose any more Dan Whitnables.  It&#39;s really not that hard.  In the present case, as soon as the thought came into your head, you could have done a post, to give your precious users as early a heads-up as possible.</p>

<p>By the way, how much of your own money were your trading on Quantopian?  Where will you move it?  Or do you have access to the prime broker?  </p>

If your decision is already made which I am afraid it is from the wording of your post, I would like to thank you for taking the time to answer a couple of my questions regarding pipelines (early on when I was clueless with the purpose/ intent of the pipeline) and I wish you the very best in your future endeavors.  </p>

Quantopian is the best site I have found for individual quantitative traders, I met so many talented guys here, I cloned their algorithms, I learned a lot and I tried my own, I spent ton of hours just to make my algos profitable, I do live trading since I want to get returns from my efforts. Now obviously, I am not the user Quantopian cares about, but how could Quantopian grow if all users like me are locked out?<br>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>So for those who focus more on individual brokage real-money trading (instead of Q contest), i spent a few days and do some crack and summarize the following possible directions :<br>
1. Go to IB and learn their native API (i only know a little bit on python and it is really hard for me)<br>
2. Go to Dr. Hui Liu <a href="http://www.ibridgepy.com/">http://www.ibridgepy.com/</a> and (hopefully) it works like Q and minimize our learning curve / programming overhead<br>
3. Go to <a href="http://www.zipline-live.io/">http://www.zipline-live.io/</a><br>
I believe i will go to (1), although the starting learning cost is VERY high.  The IB API is a bit &quot;low-level&quot; for me, and it can throw a lot of terrible traceback error messages on day 1.  However, i believe this is a long-term effort.  I do not want to rely any more third-party API (such as 2 or 3), because i am unsure whether their API development is susintable or not.<br>
Please correct me if i am wrong (and guide me to the right direction).<br>
Also, i will email the above to Dr Hui Liu and see how he comments as well.  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>@fawce,</p>

<p>I&#39;m new to this community, but I spent a good chunk of my career in the Linux Kernel community as a major contributor.  I have seen many open source communities come and go...the one thing I do understand is how to cultivate it.  Do not take the community you&#39;ve built for granted.  It is not easy.</p>

<p>If your goal is to cultivate a community to being able to address the institutional investors problems, you have to think of how you are going to get members from point A to point C.   How I started (and I suspect many people here) was wanting to learn how to algo trade with their personal goal of being able to do algo trading for themselves (call that point A).  We learn enough to put our first algo live and put our money on the line (point B).  When money is on the line, there&#39;s a lot more skin in the game to learn and improve.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve only done 1 algo I was going to personally trade on, but through that process I have developed the lens of how to do the next one that could be adopted to an institution (point C).  And an institution algo was going to be my next focus.</p>

<p>Without point B, you can&#39;t get enough members to come in the first place to build the pipeline of knowledge to get to the institutional knowledge level.  </p>

<p>IMO, it&#39;s idealistic to think people are going to come here in any meaningful way to learn about institutional algos to get a job some day.  Anyone who is good wants to trade for themselves.  </p>

I&#39;m suggesting that beating by the averages it means somebody else must underperform the averages. And I don&#39;t just mean tautologically, but cause-and-effect. As per your example, give Vanguard one point alpha due to some trading sophistication, it will cause an equal drop in alpha for market participants that lack that sophistication. While you help one group of people, you hurt another group of people.</p>

<p>So my question was simply -- whose money exactly are we multiplying if we are awarded an allocation?  Is it exclusively endowments and other noble causes?  Do we get to know?  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>@Veridian, this is a useless debate, and it should not be in this thread. It is too elementary, so econo 101. </p>

<p>Vanguard manages some $3T. The money does not belong to Vanguard, they only manage it for millions of people from all walks of life who want not only to preserve their capital but have it appreciate for their retirement. For the service, Vanguard charges a well deserved fee, less than 1%.</p>

<p>So, if Vanguard manages to get market average (r_m), the bulk of it goes to the people they provide the service to. Since historical r_m is close to 10% CAGR dividends included, let&#39;s make a rough estimate: $3B for Vanguard, and $297B for the people. That is a very noble cause.</p>

<p>The millions of people using Vanguard as their money manager do it in spite of us able to generate much higher returns based on our backtests (r_m + α). They must have a reason. I think that the primary one is: they know they will win.</p>

<p>The millions of people putting their confidence in Vanguard did not rob or deprived anybody else. Market returns go to those participating in the game, those that take the risk. </p>

<p>If you sell your shares, the other side did not lose, it just started its participation. Lotteries are won by those buying tickets. If you do not buy any, you can not claim a prize, but you can say, in probability, that you did not lose a dime either.  </p>

To that I&#39;m thankful for Quantopian, but I&#39;ll move on once the first place that opens up Robinhood integration is set up.

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>This has been a terrific thread.  Just starting here, and it really gives me an insightful overview.   So here goes:  my interest is not in making money so much as it is in the very long haul.  I believe that ai, robots, and automation will take over the world economy in the next fifty years or so.  Some sort of ai will be providing data on companies (broadly speaking) that will profit from whatever the state of the world is by then.  Selecting those companies will be the real market task by then to pick market return for national funds that provide everyone with an appropriate standard of living.  Imagine, for instance, that this national fund will provide $10 T income for everyone in the US.  If the market return is, say, 10% to make the arithmetic simple, that means a national fund of $100T.  Figuring out how to do that without corruption is our real goal.  Seems to me that Q is the way to go, and if those who are just using it as a convenient trading vehicle for personal gain want to scurry away, good riddance.  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>@Grant, agreed. </p>

<p>Individually, we are dealing with different perceptions of the same datasets trying in each of our own ways to arbitrage the quasi-random like price movements based on whatever criteria we may fancy at any one time or other.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, the goal, for anyone of us, is not necessarily to win the lottery ticket of an allocation. I see it more in designing the highest alpha generating strategy at least risk possible or acceptable. This even outside of Quantopian&#39;s preferences. </p>

<p>Over the long haul, it is the alpha that will make a difference. No one, at the end of the game is going to ask: were you scared? They will only want to know how well you did compared to a benchmark&#39;s metrics. If they also ask: was it tough? Answer yes.</p>

<p>Regardless, we do have to make choices. The question is: is there enough left under the Quantopian sun to still justify using it? </p>

<p>It is like in any other type of problem. You use the tools at your disposal until you find better ones, or find the ones that can do the job you want. I don&#39;t think we are here to answer Quantopian&#39;s needs, but our own. Surprisingly, at times, those objectives or preferences might coalesce.  </p>

The fact that you have provided so much free content thus far regardless of your motives is still worth celebrating because we have, as a community, benefited greatly.  Speaking for myself, through this community my knowledge of the investing world has increased substantially.  So I just wanted to thank you again and want to encourage you on: onto many more years of bold ideas, pushing what is possible, and sharing many more successes with a great community.  All the best.  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>There are <strong>WAY</strong> too many posts on here that I agree with, and I wish I could list them all, but a few points I think should (need) be made:</p>

<p>Dan Dunn says that there wasn&#39;t evidence of algos that would fit the institutional model. Why on earth are we going to spend the time optimizing an algo for a $1mil portfolio when the majority of us have $50k to trade and the possibility of getting an allocation is pretty much zero? Furthermore, developing that sort of strat is pretty hard to do when we can only trade equities, and futures for live trading just became a thing how long ago?? Creating institutional caliber strategies when we aren&#39;t provided institutional caliber data is a fool&#39;s errand. I am very grateful for Morningstar and 8,000 equities, but c&#39;mon, we all know that&#39;s just a sliver of what&#39;s out there. Uncorrelated strategies at HFs are not using the &#39;Q1500&#39; . I think a good example of an institutional strategy is risk parity, consisting of foreign/domestic govt bonds, TIPS, currencies, options, futures, equities etc etc. We had the option to use two of these asset classes, with US only constraints. If you&#39;re wondering why you didn&#39;t get enough serious algos, I personally think because at the end of the day, we all knew we&#39;d look somewhat similar considering what we had to work with. </p>

<p>Its also very disheartening to hear that Quantopian wants to cater to the institutional crowd, as if <em>every other HF</em> isn&#39;t already doing this. Fawcett&#39;s post makes it sound like the institutions are bleeding out and they need you. That&#39;s sort of pathetic. When their AUM is in the billions, I seriously doubt they&#39;re going to come crying to Quantopian for help. The so called quant revolution has been happening for years. The picture it seems you&#39;re trying paint is that it hasn&#39;t, and you&#39;ll be the first to capture it. You guys are great at what you do, but you&#39;re dreaming if you think the CALPERS of the world are coming to you instead of hiring a handful of brains (like some of the members on this site) to bypass you completely. </p>

<p>Your platform gave us &quot;little&quot; traders power. You gave us the ability to feel like we could compete with the Bridgewaters and AQRs of the world even if we only had a fraction of AUM. <strong>THIS</strong> was your value proposition. The real reward wasn&#39;t winning your competition, it was creating something for ourselves and profiting from it. I&#39;m sure I speak for a large portion of members on here when I say I would&#39;ve been more than happy to pay a monthly fee to keep the status quo. You should know first hand how much us traders are willing to shell out in order to create portfolios/monitor performance. You could&#39;ve taken that money and built out more of your infrastructure, supplied more data etc etc.  While you may have had long discussions on this, it doesn&#39;t seem like you&#39;ve thought long about the ramifications of ditching the little guys. </p>

<p>You got greedy... As if there wasn&#39;t enough of that already in the world of finance. </p>

<p>Out of respect for capitalism, I wish Quantopian the best of luck. But more importantly,  I truly believe you&#39;re going to need it.  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>@Tom . You make some very good points. I think Q&#39;s real value proposition was to compete with the Wealthfront&#39;s of this world, not the AQR&#39;s.<br>
The fact that Q has taken such a radical solution seems a bit surprising. There would be so many simple solutions that would not strand thousand of small time players and wannabe quants, whicle continuing to provide a robust community environment where future quant stars could emerge.</p>

<p>We know the Q solution suffers from the 1 minute bar restriction - which effectively discards it for many intraday trading applications. But that still leaves throusands of other profitable applications to be developeed that could benefit live traders, without necessarily fitting into the Quantopian risk profile of $1 mm plus account sizes and low beta rules.</p>

<p>If Q no longer wants to spend money supporting IB and RH, but only have to maintain the interface to the one broker it has chosen to deal with - and assuming that prime broker does not want to deal with small accounts - why not simply provide an xml based uri messaging service that simply prints out orders as the algo&#39;s determine that a trading order is called for? </p>

<p>It would be up to the individual user to tie that xml signal into the TWS or RH api to generate a trade there. </p>

<p>Quantopian could charge a fee for each message sent, thereby generating millions of dollars of new revenue WITHOUT signifciant admininstrative costs..  This would make Q more attractive than ever, opening it up to users of many other brokerages. </p>

<p>Simulataneously, this would not endanger or infringe on Q&#39;s propietary data feed agremeents with third party vendors, as this data could not be exported through that XML. Only the buy / sell orders could be transmitted.</p>

<p>Quantopianers, what do you say?  </p>

</blockquote>

<p>This may be more complicated than one might think from a licensing standpoint.  For example, rather than sending buy/sell orders, one could transmit price &amp; volume data (or other data, as well).  For example, a price of $10.57 could be sent as an order for 1057 shares.  My guess is that any scheme that transmits licensed data directly into the hands of individuals will be a non-starter, given the efforts Q has put into keep the data with the confines of their API.</p>

<p>That said, if someone has the time, they could call Nanex and ask them what it would take to provide a Quantopian-compatible feed, and report back here.  My bet, though, is that they won&#39;t have a solution, since any feed that can&#39;t be audited could be split into N feeds and sold, under-cutting their business.  Quantopian has the advantage that the data usage (historical and live feeds) can be audited from a licensing standpoint (and Quantopian has a lot to lose by violating licensing terms, whereas all bets are off with individuals).  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>I am deeply dissatisfied with the stopping of the live trading algorithm. The point of quantopian was to create an algorithm, refine it with the backtester and then use it to live trade (you can also get an allocation but no one will use it for that specific purpose). There is no point in using your backtester with another company&#39;s live trading software. Thus there is then no reason to use quantopian. I really hope you will change your idea. At most, make us pay for it, an extra commission or a small monthly fee will be fine with almost everyone, like other comments have mentioned.  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>In my opinion IBridgePy looks pretty amateurish compared to Quantopian&#39;s platform. IBridgePy did an IB webinar last year which I attended; I didn&#39;t get the impression that the people behind it are professional software developers. </p>

<p>QuantConnect looks more professional and is outwardly most similar to Quantopian. My issue with QuantConnect is that I agree with someone else who pointed out that it&#39;s not Python-based; they have Python bindings but it&#39;s just C# in Python clothing. Not ideal if like me you want to stick with the Python data science stack.</p>

<p>I also came across <a href="https://www.quantrocket.com/">QuantRocket</a> which says it will support Zipline along with another backtester, with live trading and data from IB. Doesn&#39;t help me right now because it&#39;s still under development and says it won&#39;t launch until early 2018. Also, they have a free tier but the paid tier is quite a bit more expensive than QuantConnect at $100/mo and up.</p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>Hi fawce, Dan, </p>

<p>Only had the time to comment on this now.</p>

<p>First and foremost, let me express my sincerest gratitude to Quantopian. You’ve opened the door (to me and many others) to the complex world of quant finance and trading, making it completely accessible to anyone and you’ve done it with incredible simplicity, sense of community and, let’s not forget, completely free. You achieved something very special!</p>

<p>Not being able to trade live with my own money is a serious setback, but still I look forward to continue contributing by learning, experimenting and participating. Most of the data, the research capability, backtesting, the tutorials, the lectures…etc., are still immensely valuable tools at our disposal and I believe that exploring them is the greatest investment one can make and that will yield the biggest returns. Thank you for keeping it accessible.</p>

<p>A note of worry: the option to alternatively trade your own money if you don’t get your algo allocated is arguably the biggest pull for newcomers that are willing to invest a lot of time researching and coding. My bet is that your numbers will suffer significantly, since there already are qualified alternatives; that ironically were following your footsteps…</p>

<p>A question I think you should have answered is: granted you have a few hundred members trading live, accounting for a small percentage of the community, but, how many of those are solid contributors to the institutional aspect of Quantopian in relation to the community? I don&#39;t believe they&#39;ll be motivated to stay. I suspect the opportunity to trade live with your own money is what&#39;s feeding true talent, in a way that you’re still motivated to evolve and develop since you can still make use of your work at your own risk if you don&#39;t get an allocation. With this measure, part of that motivation will dissipate...</p>

<p>Thank you again, truly!  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>Is the final take away from this thread that if you want to live trade you have to move to an alternative like:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.quantconnect.com/">https://www.quantconnect.com/</a><br></li>
<li><a href="https://www.quantrocket.com/">https://www.quantrocket.com/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>as Q is not offering trade your self model and if you want to participate in the competition and / or get an allocation you should use Q?</p>

<p>As for other pursuing the allocation model we have:<br>
 - Q,<br>
 - <a href="https://info.cloudquant.com/">https://info.cloudquant.com/</a>,<br>
 - <a href="https://websim.worldquantchallenge.com/en/cms/wqc/websim/">https://websim.worldquantchallenge.com/en/cms/wqc/websim/</a>,<br>
 - <a href="https://www.quantiacs.com/Home.aspx">https://www.quantiacs.com/Home.aspx</a></p>

<p>In pursuing the competition model we have:<br>
 - Q,<br>
 - <a href="https://websim.worldquantchallenge.com/en/cms/wqc/competition/">https://websim.worldquantchallenge.com/en/cms/wqc/competition/</a>,<br>
 - <a href="https://www.quantiacs.com/Home.aspx">https://www.quantiacs.com/Home.aspx</a></p>

<p>Also it would be of interest what what others follow each model, i.e.,</p>

<ul>
<li>trade your self<br></li>
<li>competition<br></li>
<li>allocation</li>
</ul>

<p>And also what would be pros and cons of each and why is Q better? Initially Q covered all the bases which others did not do.  </p>

<p>Also something I noticed is that about a days after this announcement the number of QC users reported on their website was 33k. Now it has gone up to 37.4k.  So the option to live trading must matter to some like the competition and allocation even though there were few live traders?  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>So, unlike most people in this conversation, I only discovered Quantopian a couple weeks ago, and didn&#39;t have time to reap the benefits, and I am still massively disappointed.   I did spent a lot of time learning Python and creating my first algo only to learn that I can&#39;t use it live.  The thing I&#39;m most disappointed about, though, is that there was absolutely no warning from Quantopian so that I could stop learning this and quit wasting my time the past couple weeks.  Also leaves Robinhood users with no options, which is frustrating, now that I got a taste of what could have been.  I guess I understand the variety of reasons to go this route with your business, but pulling the rug from under your users is mean.  </p>

<p>You should really update docs and posts as soon as possible, otherwise other people will only sign up thinking robinhood integration is possible, like me.  It was very hard to find information about broker support being deprecated until I finally found this post.  Might have to find something other than &quot;Leveling Wall Street&#39;s Playing Field&quot; now.</p>

<p>@John Fawcett:  From the outside, it&#39;s hard to see why providing a service to institutions is mutually exclusive with providing services to individual investors, especially if you left the current functionality untouched for individual investors.  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>A year of waste. As a 25 yo new to the community and quant trading this is a major disappointed. When I first found out about Quantopian after joining RH at the beginning of the year I was so fascinated by the Idea of being able to develop an automated trading system. What drew me even more to Quantopian was the contest. The thought of being to build something and then get paid for it if it was good and seemed like a great concept. Also knowing  that there was and escape goat to trade that same code for your own account if it wasn&#39;t chosen pretty much sealed the deal. I knew I was a long way from being at a level needed to develop a high end and efficient algo that would make the cut, but as the saying goes practice makes perfect and you need to start somewhere. </p>

<p>Pretty much came to Quantopian with this exact thought process. </p>

<p>1) Teach myself python,<br>
2) learn what makes a good strategy through the references and forums.<br>
3)  code an algo. and enter the contest. If didn&#39;t win but still made returns trade on my own account. Eventually if I could have made consistent income, I would have quit my full time job and focused full time on research and coding instead of just a couple hours a week in order to hopefully develop the large scale algos that Quantopian was looking. </p>

<p>Like all hedge funds you need full time coders and researcher and I&#39;m pretty sure none of them are working for free. In this case the live trading seemed to be the income source of some of the individuals on and with out that you are basically forcing your opened sourced employees to leave. </p>

<p>It would be my luck that I get 95% though my first algo and this happens before it ever gets to see live trading. I guess it time to just look for a job at a hedge fund and get a steady income and a big bonus for doing well.  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>So now quantopian wants its users to work hard and get no returns. What will motivate people to write code if they cannot implement it. Also finding other alternatives is not a solution. Now we got to spend even more time learning another platform and most likely there will be limitations on the brokers there too. I cant believe I wasted my semester doing your tutorials. You throw out the alternatives as if everybody knows coding well enough to integrate their broker by themselves. The truth is quantopian got a couple of good algorithms and the profits are better than running the website like they did. They never cared a single bit about the community. They just wanted free algorithms from the users. How are you &quot;Leveling The Playing Field&quot; now? What about the hundreds of users that are halfway finished with an algo they worked on for a year and they can never trade it? where is the incentive there? The hopes that it will win a contest and get selected for funding? So if someone is smart enough to write an algo that great but not amazing he cant benefit from it. Im cancelling as will thousands of others. What a huge lying disappointment.  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>What I really want from Quantopian is: Adding a message system based on their Paper Trade, when Paper Trade trigger a trade signal, sending a message, via calling a Restful API which URI is defined by clients. By this clients can do real-money&amp;real-time trade by their own brokers. The format of message is defined by Quantopian, supporting trade type, number and stocks etc., like what order_target_percent is doing. Quantopian could charge us for the cost per message.</p>

<p>As an alternative solution of shutdown current brokerage integration, the modification effort of this is minor and also the maintain cost of integration with brokers are transferred from Quantopian to clients. General speaking, Quantopian get their purpose and clients are also not pain, win-Win solution.  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>I&#39;d stopped &quot;listening&quot; to this forum thread, but there is an interesting topic here.  I&#39;ve been involved with Quantopian (Q) as a lowly user since 2012.  It has been remarkable, the amount of money poured into the effort.  Fawce &amp; Co. must either have friends in high places or have a mighty fine elevator speech.  In any case, there was a grand experiment of offering sophisticated retail trading to the masses, and it basically failed.  Out of more than 100,000 reported users with some pretty darn-good resources, we reportedly have ~ 200 ambitious folks (and perhaps some small start-up &quot;institutions&quot;) trading real money.  I&#39;d think that anyone considering starting up a business in this domain would need first to explain why they will succeed, when the Q experiment with retail trading failed.  It sure seems like the market is not very well understood.  Why would the various traditional &quot;online brokers&quot; not have failed miserably by now, or at least seen the writing on the wall and started to play catch-up?  At one point, Q was working on partnering with E-Trade, and the deal fell through and Robinhood jumped in.  The market is saying something when you can&#39;t even give away your product.  Any insights?  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>@Grant, I haven&#39;t been around here since 2012 so I don&#39;t know what was Quantopian plan at that time. Was it the  Q hedge fund or was it the retail trading one?  If the main Quantopian goal has always been the hedge fund then the failure of retail trading business is less dramatic.  Quantopian didn&#39;t invest all its resources in expanding the retail trading features (e.g. how long people have been asking for FOREX?), this might explain the failure.</p>

<p>It would be interesting to know how many users are actually live trading their algorithms on QuantConnect (37000+ users), a platform whose core business is providing live trading features to their users. This would give us more insights on the state of algorithmic trading at retail level. Unfortunately, we don&#39;t know those numbers.  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>@Grant, I believe the reported 100K+ users refers to registered users, not active users. I suspect the number of active users is substantially lower. Last year when Quantopian <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Papers.cfm?abstract_id=2745220">published their paper</a> on in-sample vs out-of-sample performance using Quantopian backtests, I remember being surprised that out of such a large user base (already over 100K at the time) they only found 888 backtests to include in their study. This suggests to me that a lot of users sign up, poke around, clone an algorithm or two, but are not active, serious users of the platform. </p>

<p>This may not materially change your point about how small the number of serious retail quants appears to be, but it does suggest that live trading per se may not be the point at which the drop-off occurs. When I line up the available data points -- 100K+ registered users, &lt;1K usable backtests for the Q paper, and a few hundred live traders -- the number of live traders looks reasonable relative to the number of usable backtests; it&#39;s the number of usable backtests that looks surprisingly low relative to the registered user base.  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>@George, as you started talking about numbers what about contest entries? They are ~500 only. Considering that each user can submit 3 algorithms, then we have less than 100 users competing. This and your consideration should tell something about how many users have the interest and skills to write trading algorithms. As for the Q hedge funds a few dozens of algorithms are probably enough (I guess), the number of active users is not a problem, but it is for keeping live trading alive.  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>The Q hedge fund concept was introduced in the fall of 2014 (see <a href="https://pando.com/2014/10/16/calling-all-quants-quantopian-is-launching-a-hedge-fund-and-wants-you-to-manage-the-money/">https://pando.com/2014/10/16/calling-all-quants-quantopian-is-launching-a-hedge-fund-and-wants-you-to-manage-the-money/</a>).  The introduction was fairly general, with a notion that if lots of uncorrelated algos could be cobbled together, the result would be spectacular.  The Q paper (discussed <a href="https://www.quantopian.com/posts/q-paper-all-that-glitters-is-not-gold-comparing-backtest-and-out-of-sample-performance-on-a-large-cohort-of-trading-algorithms">here</a>) perhaps was a wake up call that a more sophisticated approach would be required; even an infinite number of monkeys on typewriters will not produce a hedge fund.  The latest insight, it would seem, is that the Venn diagram of individuals capable and interested in conjuring up algos for a hedge fund and individuals doing algorithmic retail trading with their own money is a diagram of two nearly non-intersecting circles. There isn&#39;t enough synergy for it to make sense to offer both.  The arduous, uncertain slog to get to the point where one could queue up for a six month wait for possibly no feedback whatsoever on a Q fund effort and then another long wait for an even less certain payout is a very different equation compared to controlling one&#39;s own destiny with one&#39;s own capital (however meager).  The Internet offers a great opportunity to employ Pavlovian conditioning on the masses, but if only a few are rewarded, then only a few will become conditioned.  It will be interesting to see what Fawce means by &quot;we need to reward more community members&quot; and if rewards could be extended to <em>all</em> community members.  The other thing that the Internet enables these days is micropayments.  My guess is that the <a href="https://blog.quantopian.com/a-professional-quant-equity-workflow/">framework presented by Jonathan Larkin</a> is a tried-and-true recipe from the industry; it is nothing new.  The question is how could it be adapted so that an itsy-bitsy contribution (e.g. a weak, transient alpha factor) could be rewarded with an itsy-bitsy payment (e.g. cryptocurrency).  It would be easier to get the crowd to work for peanuts than for no reward at all (and trying to get the crowd to pay to work, a la Tom Sawyer, by charging for data sets seems completely unrealistic, but I ain&#39;t no psychologist--why are non-free <a href="https://www.quantopian.com/data">premium data sets</a> still advertised?). </p>

<p>While I am disappointed that Q had to shut down the IB link, finding no business interest in maintaining it, I am grateful for their continued contributions to zipline and zipline-live, alongside their other tools in the research environment.  I think this is still a great research environment, even if putting the ideas to production will now require more effort.  Hopefully with continued efforts from the community, this will eventually become easy for most people.  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>So long live trading on Quantopian, this week is the last one for this service. </p>

<p>All in all, I can understand Quantopian decision, I don&#39;t like it and this platform won&#39;t be the same as before, but still I understand it. What really surprised me is how quickly they shut down the service. If we had had few months notice then zipline-live would have been ready and all the users could have jumped there with a smooth transition and less frustration. It didn&#39;t happen though, this is weird because the live trading has been active for years, why not giving the users few more months instead of just one? Q started the zipline-live project to give the users a viable alternative but it wasn&#39;t and it isn&#39;t ready to fully replace the live trading service. I see a conflict here, they tried to provide a solution but they didn&#39;t give the users enough time to make the solution effective.  Why is it? Maybe an external decision forced Q to shut down the service in a hurry? Or is this simply bad management? Who knows, I am writing this just to share thoughts with other people. </p>

<p>We will see what the future brings.  </p>

<p>This falls under the heading of &quot;<a href="http://www.dictionary.com/browse/cut-one-s-losses">cut one&#39;s losses</a>&quot; in business-speak.  As you say, live trading has been active for years.  The amount of direct and indirect (opportunity) costs must be quite high.  If the intent was to capture a significant chunk of the large retail trading (i.e. gambling) market and then profit off of it directly, the effort was a total flop.  My assumption is that the retail market is basically legalized gambling; the overlap with the kind of R&amp;D required to build institutional products is minimal, at best.  Making money in the retail sphere means getting users to do things with their time and money that rationally are unproductive.  For Quantopian, my hunch is that the argument was that there would be an attraction of talent, enticed by the retail trading offering, that would then learn how to do the serious work of mining alpha for the institutional side of the business.  The outward appearance is that this business strategy did not work.  In the business world, when something bubbles up as being a money pit, it just gets axed pronto (several mixed metaphors, I know, but this isn&#39;t the NY Times).  Stop the losses as fast as possible.</p>

<p>The good news is that it is implicit here that Quantopian has enough users who are interested and capable of contributing to the fund effort that they don&#39;t need the retail trading honey pot anymore.  However, my sense is that the whole &quot;crowd-sourced&quot; concept will be dropped, or at least played down, if Quantopian makes it big time.  I could be mistaken, but it&#39;ll morph into a recruiting arm of a larger, more traditional enterprise.</p>

<p>I kind of agree with your view and time will tell.  Still I find weird that Quantopian put effort in starting the zipline-live project.  If they don&#39;t care about the few hundreds users who live trade then why wasting time starting  zipline-live? And if they care about the live trading users, why not giving enough time before shutting down the service so that zipline-live would have been a viable alternative? I find the starting of zipline-live and the rush of shutting down the service counterintuitive.  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>One potentially interesting angle here is that if there were lots of overlap between uncorrelated alpha and retail trading, I&#39;d think that the traditional retail brokers would have detected it, and found a way to profit from it.  For example, presumably IB has a data base of every account and every trade.  If there were some magic to retail trading, that generated institutional-grade alpha, then one would expect it to have been discovered and tapped a long time ago.  The fact that Quantopian thought there might be something there might have been a stretch (whether directly, which I think was the original game plan, or indirectly by attracting retail traders who&#39;d also to a significant extent be capable of mining institutional alpha).  </p>

(or what it can be). I won&#39;t thanks them enough for this.
On the other side, they should be aware that their growth is partially due to their community.<br>
Maybe we could expect from them to open source their backend that made real trading possible.<br>
My opinion is that there is a room for a web only algo trading website.<br>
Quantopian doesn&#39;t use tick data, they still don&#39;t adress Forex or CFD market.<br>
I&#39;d love a website with <a href="https://www.quantopian.com/posts/alternative-editor">git integration</a>, with <a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia</a> as backtester but I&#39;m not a DevOps...<br>
and for such a website backend is as much important as frontend.<br>
So I really hope to see their backend open sourced as a way to compensate us.</p>

Getting an allocation is a long shot but investing my own money motivated me to learn more. As Dan Whitnable mentioned the community will never be the same again. It is sad to see such a big change was made good quantitative traders can always find work or sell their ideas to hedge funds but this will diminish the learning and development of individuals like me. </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>Of course the time will show, but in my opinion, the decision to phase out is fundamentally wrong for Q. It may save some resources and improve Q&#39;s financial results in the short run, but from a long-term perspective this decision will not pay off. There are two sources of returns: beta and alpha, and, as a full-time trader dependent on the performance of my strategies, I need to have algos that have significant amount of beta, which will provide me with some bread and butter for living. Having that kind of algos in place, I can then focus on developing algos that meet Q&#39;s criteria. That&#39;s how I see it work for a full-time trader in general and me personally. Now, without a significant number of full-time algo traders around, Q will be left with strategies created mostly by hobbyists. While this may not be a bad thing, and there may be good algos, their quality may differ considerably. That is just my opinion.  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>I agree. I think the people who help build this platform should be able to benefit from it. I&#39;m working with the IB API now to replicate what I have done on this platform, so I can utilize my strategies and benefit from them. I understand the rationale though. It was to isolate people who were interested in helping Quantopian make money. The question is, will they actually benefit at all from what they create. If 100 people create stellar algorithms, and one guy benefits from winning a contest, does Quantopian benefit in some way? That is the question. How can they evaluate an algorithm without looking at it? If you enter their contest, don&#39;t they have to look at your algorithm? It&#39;s unclear in the terms, which is why I chose to copyright my work. If Quantopian is somehow seeking to capitalize on the vast majority of it&#39;s coders, compensating a few, and capitalizing on the rest, this thing will come tumbling down sooner or later like a house of cards.  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>RIP Quantopian.</p>

<p>1 way to kill a start = anger and alienate all your most passionate users</p>

<p>A platform that I once lauded and recommended to anyone interested in quant trading and finance as groundbreaking and democratizing has just gone against their core mission by alienating the most passionate users of their community. It is just the beginning of the end. Even though I was not one of the &#39;200&#39; users who used live trading, I&#39;ve been hacking around on Quantopian for years ONLY because one day I could deploy my best performing algos on real money. The ability to make real money is the main reason to use the platform to learn in the first place. If you remove the primary incentive, then there is no reason to use it at all. Economics 101. People don&#39;t want to play with monopoly money just to win an unlikely prize controlled and determined by the company. I used to compare Quantopian to Github, and this would be as if Github decided one day to ban open source in favor of private enterprise repos only. Quantopian is no longer a platform; Quantopian is a hedge fund ripping off other people&#39;s quant algos. It&#39;s astonishing that after this much backlash, they are too hardheaded to change course, consider a pivot, or just keep the damn feature. I&#39;m sure subscription revenue would easily offset the cost of pesky bug fixing. I&#39;m sure Quantconnect and Quantiacs are relishing in their newfound business from this sad self-destruction of a startup.</p>

<p>As Mr. Wonderful and @DanielEpperson said, you are dead to me now.  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>There is a larger context here, which is how businesses chose to relate to the people on which they rely for success.  Quantopian keeps missing opportunities, in my opinion.  For example, they quietly filed to set up their hedge fund (see <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001707128/000170712817000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml">SEC FORM D</a>).  As far as I know, there was no discussion with the crowd regarding the name.  And to my knowledge, the crowd has no ownership of it or representation in running it.  My guess is that there is no legal obligation to tell the crowd anything.  Based on the information I have, it is really not a novel crowd-sourced fund.  That said, I&#39;ve yet to hear about any so-called crowd-sourced finance effort taking a fundamentally different path.  My sense is that Quantopian is running with the pack.  I guess to get tens of millions in funding, it is a hard sell to do otherwise.</p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>Well, Quantopian is/was a startup so it is/was difficult to be sure about their future plans. I hoped, but not expected, that live trading could be a viable business for them, but it turned out it isn&#39;t unfortunately. How can we be angry for that? It costs money to keep the service running, it cannot be done for charity. I don&#39;t like that but I can understand it.</p>

<p>Still, I am disappointed on how they handled the shutting down of the service. They could have warned us far in advance than a single month and also they could have provided a viable solution before shutting down the service. I initially and erroneously  thought that <a href="http://www.zipline-live.io">www.zipline-live.io</a> was a Quantopian project, but it isn&#39;t, so I wonder if  Quantopian put some effort at all in helping the project.</p>

<p>John Fawcett said in his post that Quantopian wants &quot;to help people find other ways to trade their own money algorithmically, One possible option is the zipline-live open source project [...] We&#39;ve talked to the project leaders, and we&#39;ve agreed to support the future development of zipline-live.&quot;</p>

<p>So they stated their intent of helping the users providing an alternative ,but if Q had really wanted to provide us with a viable solution, wouldn&#39;t have they helped <a href="http://www.zipline-live.io">www.zipline-live.io</a> and make the project ready before stopping the live trading service?</p>

<p>So I cannot blame Quantopian for shutting down the service but I am disappointed of Quantopian not having provided a viable, ready, full featured replacement for the live trading. In my opinion,  Q should have shared its brokerage integration and live trading code with zipline-live project (some effort was required, but you have to give back to the community if you really care about them), but because they didn&#39;t I am now wondering if John Fawcett really meant it when  he said &quot;help people find other ways to trade their own money algorithmically&quot;  </p>

In fact, you have way more control and freedom if you do it yourself, and you don&#39;t have to deploy the code anywhere else. Case and point, you can&#39;t see the bid or ask price to determine the spread in Quantopian. You&#39;re also forced to work with granularity by the minute. It&#39;s much more advantageous to code this yourself. Just download the IB Gateway and API&#39;s and you can start coding. They even allow python. If you&#39;re using C#, just create a project and be sure to include the DLL&#39;s. And you can use Nuget to download any sort of scheduler package you need, or simply hard code your times.

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>Thanks for posting potential open source workarounds. Is it possible to talk to the Robinhood API directly from Quantopian?</p>

<p>Has anyone considered that in order for Quantopian to even use the ‘crowd’s’ algos, they must be developing or already have a live trading agent to algorithmically trade real money presumably through a broker. Ie they turned off the feature for the crowd so they can use and improve on it for themselves. I can’t imagine they’d be able to use any algo on Quantopian without it. </p>

<p>The entire point of developing on Quantopian is the ability to trade live. To take that away from users is asinine. It could have easily been supported cost wise with a subscription of sorts. At the very least, open source the code and allow the ‘crowd’ to bugfix, maintain, and improve it. This would mitigate the risk of live trading being stolen away from users again. </p>

<p>@Grant I squarely blame Quantopian for their poor decision and botched handling of it. It’s disgraceful that they’d use (maybe steal) user-developed algos to trade client money on. I’m sure they quietly slipped it in the terms of service at some point. A friend of mine who used to evaluate new hedge fund investments for a fund of funds, actually met the Quantopian guys and heard their pitch. I knew they were going the hedge fund route and I recommended Quantopian highly at the time. I didn’t realize they’d get so greedy and shoot themselves in the foot. It feels like a betrayal of a very loyal userbase. I’ve never been so annoyed by an arbitrary product decision; it just feels so wrong. There’s something we are not being told. Maybe it was illegal and too good to be true. It’s too illogical to explain away.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>There’s something we are not being told.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree, but the behavior flows out of a larger context of how Quantopian and their funding sources have decided to set up the business.  For example, they could have set up a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative">cooperative</a> with crowd ownership and collective benefits.  They could have baked into their business a legal obligation to be transparent with the crowd.  They decided not to go this path.  The power structure is traditional and out of sync with the crowd-sourcing concept, in my opinion.  By choice, Quantopian is your typical hierarchical capitalist pyramid scheme.  When Fawce published his <a href="https://blog.quantopian.com/quantopian-manifesto/">Quantopian Manifesto</a>, with the &quot;level Wall Street&quot; rallying cry and fist in the air, I suspect the &quot;power to the people&quot; sentiment wasn&#39;t heartfelt.  The problem, though, was that the initial business model, which included retail trading, was not workable.  This was proven out recently, given that only a few hundred retail traders were participating in the Quantopian experiment; they couldn&#39;t even give it away.  It simply did not work (one might wonder why it did not work, given the size of the retail trading market; the tools turned out to be a real misfit).</p>

<p>In the end, the focus will be on a relatively small set of talented, committed quants who are contracted or hired on.  The platform is a recruiting tool to find and retain these rock stars.  Their ideas will not be their own.  This is no different from any other employee of a corporation.  If the work is done for the corporation, the IP belongs to the corporation, not the individual.  Standard operating procedure--nothing novel there.</p>

<p>If the fund hit a sudden downturn in August that would explain the presence of any thought toward changing anything, otherwise would have been smooth sailing. </p>

<p>If that&#39;s what happened, to address the problem it calls for a humble willingness to consider blind spots and the one I would focus on would be scoring, Adjustments to scoring have been a constant battle, perhaps it is time for something very different? I would try reevaluating all contest entries with a test version of metrics based on amount actually invested since starting capital is not always met (and sometimes exceeded), backtest the resulting top 20 from each of 29 completed contests with now lots of out of sample and see if any great algos are found. The outcome could be eye-opening.  </p>

I think Q should not only support core algo component like zipline, but also really help open source projects like zipline-live and IBridgePy to become more turn-key solutions for beginning algo traders.  Beginning algo traders need to experience the &quot;fun&quot; of DIY algo trading before they can begin to have interests in developing institutional class algos.

I checked in with my friend who interfaced with them raising money and he said they passed because they were not committing any of their own money. They did in fact go on to raise $250M from Steve Cohen at Point72, former SAC. </p>

<p>It will be interesting to see the realization of Fawce&#39;s statement above:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>...we need to reward more community members...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In some ways, the <a href="https://www.quantopian.com/posts/new-tool-for-quants-the-quantopian-risk-model">new risk model</a> should help align algos with institutional money (leading to more allocations), however the trend would still seems to be awarding relatively large capital allocations to a set of a few individuals.  For example, my hunch is that the 1337 Street Fund has some 
<code>short_term_reversal</code> risk by design, but prudently only wants to carry so much.  So once the fund has put an allocation to this factor (and the factor is scalable), then it essentially blocks the rest of the field from getting an allocation to this factor (and as the fund loads up on other factors, they would be added to the risk model, as well).  It is just not clear to me yet how more community members will be rewarded on a grand scale, but we&#39;ll see...</p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>This is a very simplistic question, but I&#39;m pretty new to both Quantopian and the python API of Interactive Brokers TWS. However, I have been trading using Amibroker and the IBController which allows auto trading using Amibroker and the IB TWS API for several years. I am thinking of devoting the time to learning the Quantopian system (notebooks and algorithms), using that to backtest strategies in Quantopian. Obviously based on this thread, I can no longer trade those strategies through Quantopian, hence I would have to code those strategies directly into python and use the IB TWS API to place the trades.</p>

<p>However, from the frustration I&#39;ve been reading on this page, it would seem that this isn&#39;t possible?</p>

<p>Would it be possible to backtest strategies on the Quantopian platform and then code those strategies directly into a python program for the IB TWS API? From reading this posts it would seem that data is a major issue. I guess this would prevent intraday strategies, but for an EOD trader, wuld it be possible to run explorations in Quantopian at the end of the trading day, export a file with the trade signals and then use that file to place those trades directly with the IB TWS API?</p>

<p>Again, apologies for the very simplistic questions. I&#39;m exploring spending a lot of time learning to use the platform and then the IB TWS API, and I&#39;m trying to find out whether I can actually do what I need to do before I invest all that time.</p>

<p>Thanks.  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>Yes, that&#39;s do-able. It&#39;s just code, anything is possible. Just be careful to write in such a way that most of your functions do not make site specific calls.</p>

<p>Exporting a file with the day&#39;s orders or current positions may not be terribly easy, but it&#39;s reasonably easy to read your positions in the &quot;live trade&quot; simulation with some light web scraping and it&#39;s possible to fetch a live algo&#39;s recent orders from the backend directly.<br>
Alternately, you can log the positions daily at whatever time you like and fetch the log file from the back end as well.</p>

<p>Without knowing whether the Quantopian team approves of such shenanigans, I&#39;ll have to leave the specifics as an exercise for the reader.</p>

<p>@John Fawcett If you all happen to feel like putting in a button to download logs/orders/positions or if you were to document certain api calls behind the live algo reporting, that could go a long way toward re-establishing live trading for the community while leaving the integration work to those of us who care to spend time on it.<br>
From that position, nearly complete integration with live accounts could be achieved just with the ability to change cash and &quot;restart&quot; a live simulation up to once per day. (the minor difference being that the restart feature wouldn&#39;t allow code changes but would retain the logs, charts, and context state)<br>
Even that would be just a nice-to-have though. Without it, we can still just stop and re-launch an algo with an updated cash amount whenever the sim deviates from reality too much.  </p>

<p>You may want to look at <a href="https://www.quantrocket.com/">QuantRocket</a>; they support Zipline for backtesting and are launching live trading soon, with data sourced from IB. I&#39;ve tried their platform and found it polished and intuitive.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also the <a href="https://github.com/zipline-live/zipline">zipline-live</a> project which is a fork of Zipline that is working to add live trading. I haven&#39;t used it so not sure of the status.</p>

<p>So yes, you can get started learning on Quantopian and have a few potential options for transitioning to live trading. It&#39;s hard to beat the resources Quantopian provides for learning about algorithmic trading. </p>

<p>As for re-coding your Quantopian strategies using the IB API, it&#39;s possible in theory but don&#39;t expect much if any overlap between the two and expect a steep learning curve. They serve different purposes. Quantopian/Zipline is for backtesting and performance analysis while the IB API is more about the &quot;plumbing&quot; of automated trading: getting data, submitting and managing orders, etc. The plumbing requires a lot of programming skill so I would recommend piggybacking on an existing platform like QuantRocket or zipline-live.</p>

<li>data provided by Quantopian will be different, so obviously pure quantitative technical strategies that rely on OHLCV data should be fine, using specific Quantopian datasets won&#39;t be.</li>
</ul>

<p>Apologies for the summary but I thought that might help someone else in future that has the same questions as me.</p>

<p>@Alexander Katyk, @Danny Purcell and @George K, I thank you again, each of your posts provided useful information that has helped me decide the direction I want to take. Specifically I&#39;m going to take a look at QuantRocket today, but more generally, I feel like now I can pursue further study into Quantopian knowing that while it may not be easy to migrate to live trading from there, there are several options, and I&#39;m not running myself into a dead end.</p>

<p>Thanks again.  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>Hi Fawce -</p>

<p>You dedicate a paragraph above to potential support for <a href="http://www.zipline-live.io/">zipline-live</a>.  I appreciate that your support may be more behind-the-scenes than on public display.  I also understand that in the long-run, it is beneficial if you focus on getting user algos into your 1337 Street Fund, and that the Quantopian broker integrations turned out to be a distraction.</p>

<p>Perhaps you could provide an update on your support for zipline-live?  Or maybe circumstances resulted in your dropping support?</p>

<p>This was discussed by Quantopian:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.quantopian.com/posts/phasing-out-brokerage-integrations#599cb101d8a96d001083811d">https://www.quantopian.com/posts/phasing-out-brokerage-integrations#599cb101d8a96d001083811d</a><br>

<p>The bottom line was that too few folks were trading their own money to make a go of it.</p>

<p>Additionally, my sense is that among the hobbyist crowd, a lot of folks are just interested in gambling (even though they may be deluded that they have a &quot;secret sauce&quot; edge that results in a low-risk, high-reward short-term payout).  It is not clear that your typical high-roller hobbyist retail trader will want to go through the slog of researching and writing a hedge-fund-viable strategy.  I gather that Q came to this conclusion the hard way that they needed to target a different segment of the population.</p>

<p>I suspect one big pool for Q is students and folks just getting started in their careers (i.e. with no money).  So offering real-money trading to folks with no money is by definition a non-starter.</p>

<p>The other issue is that years ago on Q, it was pointed out that individual retail traders who delve seriously in individual US stocks would be putting up ~$250K in capital (and that ~$50K would be an absolute minimum).  There are ETFs, but I gather that trading in them doesn&#39;t really overlap with the hedge fund market.</p>

<p>It would be interesting to hear from Q as to the business case for supporting zipline-live.  It is not obvious to me that it would make sense, despite Fawce&#39;s apparent enthusiasm for it above.  If I were the one going to Q VCs proposing to spend $X on zipline-live, I&#39;m not sure how I&#39;d justify it.  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>The other perspective here is that for every dollar Q spends on zipline-live it is a dollar that could have been paid out to users in various ways (e.g. contest prizes).  So, from a user perspective, say Q devotes $150K (~ 1 full-time engineer with benefits, at most) to zipline-live over the next year--that&#39;s money that could have been spent on direct pay-outs to users.  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>Confirming some of what was said, although my live Robinhood algo was around 4x original cash in 8 months when that ended last September, in penny stocks it was only relevant to Q&#39;s goals in providing me with some inspiration toward actual fund-worthy code meeting requirements. Someone from Quantopian was kind enough at that time to arrange a phone call with me to talk about the end of brokerage trading. In that call I asked if the XIV and VIX-type folks were the sort that contributed a lot to the decision. Pretty active then, they were using the system &amp; forums for their own interests alone, the opposite direction from Q&#39;s goals. The answer was yes. That would be part of it. Another part, the sporadic ordering issues with both brokers, tough to spend money resolving those for real trading not serving them well. While Q was looking to trade in IB for the new, third broker for the fund. Those are a few of the dynamics in play at that time. Now there are dynamics regarding zipline-live. Noble goals are good and I&#39;m rooting for them in their cage-match with life.  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>Yeah...I guess even if the hedge fund is successful, and Q ends up paying out millions of dollars over the next 5-10 years to the crowd, it&#39;d be a headache and distraction supporting their interest in parlaying their earnings within the Q ecosphere.  And unless they can be considered &quot;qualified&quot; rolling the money into the 1337 Street Fund wouldn&#39;t be feasible.  So, the money will flow out of Q, which would seem like a bad thing in the long run.  My hunch is that hedge funds would support a path for their employees to trade their own money, but maybe this isn&#39;t always the case.</p>

<p>The thing is, say someone gets an allocation and earns $200K, but then sees the writing on the wall that their source of alpha has decayed.  If Q had maintained broker integrations, then they might retain that quant, since he&#39;d more than likely have put the $200K in capital into a Q algo.  However, without that option, he may just move on.  Also, even if he does continue with Q, he&#39;s now on a different (and potentially competing) platform with his $200K.</p>

<p>I guess I&#39;d encourage Q to continue to do a head-scratch on this issue, since if they aspire to get to $10B in AUM, but provide no path for contracted quants to trade their own money and no path to invest in the 1337 Street Fund, retaining talent might be more challenging.  From a longer-term strategic standpoint, I&#39;m still not getting it.  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>The fact that nobody has yet completed a suitable drop-in replacement for Quantopian live trading indicates to me that, as Quantopian has pointed out, there isn&#39;t any <em>real</em> demand. Lots of bark, but when it comes down to it, no bite. I decided to code my own live trading framework from scratch in a different language and with some fundamental architectural departures. Took me roughly a week to get it up and running, and mere minutes to port my Quantopian algorithms over. Turns out this is not such a difficult problem, and not so much work. Considering the months and months that went into brainstorming the algorithms, this was a negligible addition.  If you want it in earnest, make it happen. After seeing firsthand how easy this is to build, I&#39;m tired of hearing complaining.  </p>

IBridgePy was officially introduced by Interactive Brokers on Nov 10th 2016 in their webinar.<br>
The webinar is published by IB at youtube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hogXB07OJ_I">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hogXB07OJ_I</a><br>
Most of Quantopian algorithms can run on IBridgePy even without any changes.<br>

<p>I can confirm what you said. And I am using your IBridgrPy and I am satisfied. But I wonder if one can do any backtesting with your IbridgePy by fetching historical datas from IB?</p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>@Viridian Hawk  I have also implemented my own broker integration.  The lack of conversation on the topic, especially here, may be more indicative of everyone going their separate ways rather than a lack of demand. Since it is fairly easy to do, there&#39;s just not much to talk about there.</p>

<p>@Rodrigo Nader depending on your preferred style of development and how much you want to pay for what things,<br>
<a href="https://www.quantconnect.com/pricing">https://www.quantconnect.com/pricing</a><br>
<a href="https://www.quantrocket.com/pricing">https://www.quantrocket.com/pricing</a><br>

<a href="https://quantiacs.com/For-Quants/GetStarted.aspx">https://quantiacs.com/For-Quants/GetStarted.aspx</a><br>
are each decent options. There are others out there as well.<br>
Also @Viridian Hawk, one of those ^ might qualify as the drop-in replacement you were looking for.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Quantopian is now giving me a backtesting platform and compute time for free with almost no hope of getting anything in return. As long as they are okay with that, it&#39;s fine. However, if they would like a small revenue stream to help the compute time pay for itself, I think a good number of people go for that.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m only posting because I have found a legitimate alternative for those looking at long only strategies based on specific allocations: <a href="https://mbsy.co/mVsqs">M1 Finance</a><br>
How it works: </p>

<ul>
<li>You create a portfolio based on &quot;My Pies&quot;. Each pie can have up to 100 stocks, ETFs, or Expert Pies (hand picked pies including mimicking popular Hedge Funds based on 13F SEC filing). You have control over the distribution of the pie(s).<br></li>
<li>All Pies show backtesting results, so you can have Pies on the side and just watch them before putting them in your allocation.<br></li>
<li>M1 has an option to auto-invest all cash, so whenever you make a deposit (including auto-deposit), M1 will automatically allocate based on your portfolio pie(s).<br></li>
<li>M1 has no fees like Robinhood. But even better as you can own the world without having to pay Hedge Fund / Roboadvisor management fees or ETF expense ratios.<br>

<ul>
<li>M1 can purchase partial shares. You can own $5 worth of Amazon stock.<br></li>
<li>You have control over re-balancing. M1 won&#39;t sell shares automatically to maintain the allocation. </li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>With this power, I first cancelled my Betterment account, and then transferred my Robinhood portfolio over to M1. Very happy with M1 so far as I can finally be hands off with my allocation. I don&#39;t work for M1 or have any ties to them. I just have been searching for anything to replace what was taken away by Quantopian, and I&#39;ve found what works for me.  Hopefully it can help a few of you as well. </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>I honestly don&#39;t use Q much anymore after what happened in the contest. After making 10 million on 10 million in their contest, in less than a year, and watching them hand awards to people who made 5% or less, it was pretty clear to me what was going on. When I inquired about it later, somehow the algo was stopped. You do the math. As far as I&#39;m concerned, you&#39;re better off writing your algorithms using IB&#39;s API. At least that way, you can protect what you have and don&#39;t have to worry about a group of scumbags potentially stealing your intellectual property, and selling it to their client. Also, with IB&#39;s gateway, you get total control over what you can do. You can access pre-market, post-market, level II, see Bid and Ask, and even execute hidden orders. You can&#39;t do any of that with Q and if you&#39;re building algorithms, you need to know when you can get in and out with a particular size. Simply posting an order isn&#39;t necessarily the best way to do so.  </p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>@Aniken $kywalker  You&#39;re crossing the line with that name calling. It&#39;s not appropriate to insult the people whose platform you admittedly leach off of. It&#39;s also not appropriate to be throwing around unfounded allegations as if they were true. </p>

<p>In life, there are people who complain and there are people who work towards solutions. The latter are the ones who become successful. You should either try some humility or take your raging Dunning-Kruger tantrum elsewhere. If you really had an algorithm that produces 100%+ returns risk-free why aren&#39;t you a millionaire by now? Color me skeptical.</p>

<p>Nowhere has Quantopian stated that they&#39;re handing out cash to whoever can simulate the highest returns -- so you&#39;re really missing the point. They have very demanding risk-control criteria that must be met. If you&#39;re sincere about working with Quantopian and getting an allocation for your algorithm, why haven&#39;t you submitted it to the tearsheet feedback thread? <a href="https://www.quantopian.com/posts/tearsheet-feedback-thread" rel="nofollow">https://www.quantopian.com/posts/tearsheet-feedback-thread</a> I suggest you do that.</p>

<p>Something tells me that your inflated sense of self-worth is more important to you than actually taking a look in the mirror and following through on something hard. This isn&#39;t the first time you come out swinging, alienating everybody around you, so pardon me if I haven&#39;t given you the benefit of the doubt.</p>

<div class='response-text-container post-body'><p>I dont think it’s apppropriatre to refer to Q users as leaches. Users bring their creativity to the platform. Without them, Q is nothing but an IDE. You wouldn’t accuse someone of leaching of visual studio for writing a program. So your assessment makes no sense. Also, nothing I’ve stated is false and your risk criteria and new backtest interface was introduced after the fact. I’ve made videos for that reason. Lastly, I’m very careful with my wording. Notice I said “potentially”, as you can only infer what may have happened, but it would be impossible to know if Q stole from any of the “leaches” you mentioned. So technically I did not insult anyone, but if the shoe fits, by all means, feel free to wear it.  </p>

Concentration is viewed negatively.</p>

<p>Your algo most likely was stopped due to the data you were using or the logs you were making. If it takes too long, it will get stopped. Consider cleaning it up.</p>

<p>Not sure on your argument of “potentially”. Doesn’t make sense when you explicitly said “group of scumbags”.

In a few years maybe, but certainly not now. That&#39;s the one plus I will give Q. If you learn how to use the platform, you can discover some very powerful algorithms. However, where I think most people stumble is their knowledge of actual trading is limited. My personal take is that if you&#39;re going to develop a piece of software to do anything, you either need to consult a domain expert, or be one. There are many good traders who can&#39;t program, and for every one of those, there is an equally brilliant developer who has no clue about trading. What you will find is that many of the trading strategies you read about simply won&#39;t pan out in an algorithm. You will lose a ton of money, before you learn how to make money.
